                Adding security to your web application can be done very easily, although in a coarse-grain fashion:
                you cannot tell the cartridge to allow a specific person access to some page, you would rather
                express which groups of people have permission to access a specific use-case.
            </p>
            <p>
                Again UML elegantly allows us to model this: just associate actors to your use-cases. When an actor
                is associated to a use-case it means that all users represented by that actor are allowed to call
                that use-case's actions: hyperlinks will be enabled and the server will allow access to the
                resources in the use-case's package.
            </p>
            <p>
                When a user is not permitted access to a specific use-case he will find that the hyperlinks to that
                use-case are rendered in plain text, form buttons are grayed-out, and that the server will
                not authorize any access to the resources of that use-case.
            </p>
            <p>
                To facilitate the modeling of the user groups using actors, these actors are allowed to generalize
                other actors, thereby explicitely inheriting the privileges of the parent actor.
