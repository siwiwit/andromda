            <p>
    			The page describes the modeling standards one must follow to in order
    			to use the jBpm Cartridge.

            <p>
                Most of the model elements will require a stereotype to be processed correctly, below you will find
                a table indicating on which model element you may put what stereotype, it will also
                denote which effect this has on the generation process.
