      <question>Problems installing the EJB3 cartridge?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Re-read the installation howto.  If that doesn't help, post a new topic in the EJB cartridge forum.
          Do not post in the sticky guides.

      <question>When is the EJB3 cartridge going to be released?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Hopefully soon.  Thanks to a few people who use the cartridge, we are able to fix some of the issues
          with releasing a new cartride.  Unfortunately, until JBoss AS 5, the JBoss EJB 3.0 implementation will
          not satisfy the EJB 3.0 FR specification, although it is very close.

        <p>
          That is definitely in the pipeworks.  There is some initial support in the cartridge in CVS, but no
          documentation as yet.  Stay tuned and keep your eye on the EJB cartridge forum.

      <question>Migrating from Hibernate to EJB3?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Migrating from Hibernate will be easier than you think.  Just remember that if you have specified
          tagged values with tags in the <b>andromda.hibernate</b> namespace, you need to change these to the
          corresponding tag in the <b>andromda.persistence</b> namespace.  Check the 
          <a href="profile.html">profile</a> page to find the tagged value you are looking for.

    <faq id="use_of_orm.xml">
      <question>How does an EJB 3.0 project define meta information?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          The cartridge now uses a combination of annotations and orm.xml deployment descriptor to define
          meta mapping information.  The orm.xml will override or even replace certain annotations and allows
          you to maintain full control by separating generated code and your implementation code.
