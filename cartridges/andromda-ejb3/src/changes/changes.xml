           java.lang.RuntimeException: unable to determine messagingType interface for MDB
      </action>
      <action dev="vancek" type="remove">
        Removed container configuration option via tagged value on message driven beans since it
        is no longer supported.
      </action>
      <action dev="vancek" type="add">
        Added minimumPoolSize (@andromda.ejb.mdb.pool.size.min) and maximumPoolSize
        (@andromda.ejb.mdb.pool.size.min) tagged value options for message 
        driven beans i.e. to allow singleton message driven beans.  These are added as
        activation config properties to the ejb-jar.xml.  Added documentation.
      </action>
      <action dev="vancek" type="update">
        Updated the EJB3MetafacadeModel.xml to use the maven2.repository environment variable rather than
        hard coded paths for profiles.
      </action>
      <action dev="vancek" type="update">
        If session bean is a Seam component, then don't set the bean type to stateful if the bean contains an
        attribute.  For session bean Seam components, the only way to specify it as a SFSB is via tagged value on
        the class.
      </action>
      <action dev="vancek" type="fix">
        Don't restrict rendering of accessor methods for session bean attributes that only have 'public'
        visibility.  Accessors generated for all attributes for all visilities.
      </action>
      <action dev="vancek" type="add">
        Introduce JBoss Seam components corresponding with Seam 1.0.0-CR3.
        Always generate a local interface for a session bean if it is a Seam component.
      </action>
      <action dev="vancek" due-to="tlu" type="fix">
        JIRA EJB-27 - If a session bean operation is modelled for the local view type interface, a local interface is 
        NOT generated.  When returning a view type from the EJB3SessionFacade, must lookup all business operations to 
        determine their view type individually and return a view type for the session bean to accomodate local,
        remote and both.
        Refactor service delegate templates and introduce a parent base class which all service delegates extend.
        Fix problem with exposing only remote operations as webservice endpoints.
      </action>
      <action dev="vancek" due-to="tlu" type="add">
        JIRA EJB-28 - Added support for adding ejb-jar elements to the persistence.xml.

        Generate documentation for enumeration literals.

      <action dev="vancek" type="fix">
        Inheritance hierarchies where the super class is a mapped superclass, the subclass should not
        render the DiscriminatorValue annotation.  This annotation should only be rendered in subclasses of
        single table inheritance hierarchies.
      </action>
      <action dev="vancek" type="add">
        Added FAQ support section menu to site.
      </action>
      <action dev="vancek" type="fix">
        Remove references to attributes modelled with a @Version annotation (optimistic lock value for entity) in 
        manageable service components.  Initial work removed attribute from getAttributes, but that caused problems
        from the manageable web tier action methods create and update. To account for this, allow the attribute as
        argument to the methods, but do not call the corresponding setter.
      </action>
      <action dev="vancek" type="fix">
        Moved the @Version annotation to the entity attribute.  It had no effect on the getter method.
        Removed all annotations on the corresponding getter method.
      </action>
      <action dev="vancek" type="update">
        Render the @Table annotation on every entity to avoid application server detting the default table name
        mapped to by this entity.  Currently, the annotation is only rendered when there is an inheritence hierarchy
        or a mapped superclass.
      </action>
      <action dev="vancek" type="update">
        Update the default Collection for one-to-many and many-to-many associations to the java.util.SortedSet (in
        namespace.xml).  
        Moving away from bag collection as the default since it is unnecessary in the majority of cases.  
        As a result, the @org.hibernate.annotations.Sort annotation is also rendered with a NATURAL sort type.
        The create and update methods of the manageable service implementation wraps the retrieved bag collection(List)
        for the 'many' side of the association with an appropriate collection implementation (unless java.util.List
        is specified as the default).
      </action>
      <action dev="vancek" type="fix">
        Ignore the argument on create and update methods of DAO implementation components where the corresponding 
        entity attribute is modelled as an optimistic lock value with the Version stereotype.  This should be improved
        to eliminate the attribute when retrieving the attribute collection.
      </action>
      <action dev="vancek" type="update">
        Each finder is overloaded in the DAO components.  One finder method that doesn't supply a manual query 
        argument should use the NamedQuery defined on the corresponding entity.  Currently, it generates the query.
      </action>
      <action dev="vancek" type="fix">
        Minor fixes to the EJBQL of the finder methods in the manageable service base for manageable entities.
      </action>
      <action dev="vancek" type="fix">
        In the findAll method of the manageable service base implementation, the query now includes 'left join fetch'
        for all related 'many' association ends where the target entity does not define a display attribute (where
        the attribute is modelled with the Unique stereotype).
      </action>
      <action dev="vancek" type="update">
        Updated the metafacade definitions of EJB3AssociationEndFacadeLogicImpl, EJB3AssociationEndFacadeLogicImpl
        and EJB3MessageDrivenOperationFacadeLogicImpl in metafacade.xml.
      </action>
      <action dev="vancek" type="add">
        Added support for default list, set and map type implementations for collection association ends in 
        namespace.xml.  Also added the ability
        for association end collection index name and type (further map support) to be specified via tagged values 
        @andromda.persistence.collection.index and @andromda.persistence.collection.index.type.  This introduced
        a new facade called EJB3TypeFacade.
        Every collection type association end now instantiates the corresponding implementation upon
        declaration.
      </action>
      <action dev="vancek" type="fix">
        Fixed isRequired in EJB3AssociationEndFacade and EJB3EntityAttributeFacade to exclude property if
        the entity has a generalization to an mapped superclass.
      </action>
      <action dev="vancek" type="update">
        EJB3ManageableEntityAssociationEndFacade now also extends EJB3AssociationEndFacade with precedence tagged value
        set.  EJB3ManageableEntityAttributeFacade also extends EJB3EntityAttributeFacade.  This eliminates the
        need for the existing overwritten methods in the manageable entity facades.
      </action>
      <action dev="vancek" due-to="tlu" type="fix">
        JIRA EJB-34 - Fix erroneous signature of entity constructor where no entity attributes exist but navigable 
        associations do exist.
      </action>
      <action dev="vancek" type="update">
        Revert the build back to using the default Java compiler (1.4) - 1.5 isn't supported for the automated
        build process for andromda-plugins.
      </action>
      <action dev="vancek" due-to="tlu" type="add">
        JIRA EJB-31 - Add support for a select few meta type annotations for attribues in embedded value classes. 
        Need to confirm if @Transient, @Version, @Lob and @Basic are supported.  @Column, @Temporal and @Enumerated 
        have been confirmed to work.
      </action>
      <action dev="vancek" due-to="tlu" type="add">
        JIRA EJB-32 - Add support for embedded value object associations as well as attribute overrides.
        NOTE: This is still partial support.  The association mutators need to be added with appropriate
        annotation to the embedded value object base abstract class.
      </action>
      <action dev="vancek" due-to="tlu" type="fix">
        JIRA EJB-33 - Fix problem when there are two embedded value objects of the same type in the same entity. 
        Fix for both attribute and association overrides.
      </action>
      <action dev="vancek" due-to="tlu" type="update">
        JIRA EJB-29 - the implementation class of the embedded value object was unused and the base class was abstract.
        This is now fixed with the introduction of the orm.xml deployment descriptor.  Currently, only
        the embeddable classes are defined.  As a result the @Embeddable annotation is removed from the base abstract
        class and the embeddable implementation class is now the defined as the embeddable class using orm.xml rather
        than metadata annotation.
      </action>
      <action dev="vancek" due-to="pawel" type="fx">
        JIRA EJB-36 - Entities and composite primary keys now implement Comparable interface and implement the 
        compareTo method.
        @org.hibernate.annotations.Sort annotation is only set if the collection interface for an association end
        is defined as java.util.SortedSet.  
      </action>
      <action dev="vancek" type="add">
        Added basic JBoss Seam documentation to site docs.
      </action>

        JIRA EJB-37 - Fix problem with service delegate switch statement where the break statement should not be
        issued after a return statement. 
      </action>
      <action dev="vancek" due-to="sverker" type="fix">
        JIRA EJB-38 - The query in the DAO base class for finder methods with argument enum type has to set 
        the enum class as the parameter for the querty, not the value (name or ordinal).
      </action>
      <action dev="vancek" type="fix">
        Reset EJB3ManageableEntityAttributeFacade metafacade mapping in metafacades.xml from using property element
        to use context element.  Otherwise, manageable entity attributes would map to EJB3EntityAttributeFacade.
        This resulted in getTemporalType being refactored in EJB3EntityAttributeFacade and the overriding instance
        in EJB3ManageableEntityAttributeFacade to be removed.
      </action>
      <action dev="vancek" type="fix">
        The getter (for BLOB type manageable attributes) in the manageable service base implementation must cast 
        the single result to appropriate type before returning.
      </action>
      <action dev="vancek" type="add">
        Add @RolesAllowed annotation with permitted roles authorised to access the manageable service. This was
        achieved by introducing a new namespace property called <b>manageableRolesAllowed</b> rather than defined
        by actors with dependencies on the manageable entity.  A corresponding getManageableRolesAllowed
        is available through EJB3ManageableEntityFacade to retrieve the formatted comma separated list of roles.
      </action>
      <action dev="vancek" type="fix">
        Modelling non-public operations on session beans rendered incorrect method signatures.  This fix will
        generate correct signatures for all operations, but only public methods are exposed in the remote/local 
        interfaces and service base class.
      </action>
      <action dev="vancek" type="update">
        Updated the cartridge.xml to set the outlet for the enumerations template to a new outlet called

      <action dev="vancek" due-to="KnisterPeter" type="update">
        Changed defaultCollectionInterface namespace property to java.util.TreeSet from
        java.util.SortedSet.  This eliminates the need for the @org.hibernate.annotations.Sort annotation
        on collection association ends.  Aim is to decouple the EJB3 cartridge (with default settings) to Hibernate.
      </action>
      <action dev="vancek" type="fix">
        It is invalid to specify an implementation for defaultCollectionInterfac.  This must specify an

      </action>
      <action dev="vancek" type="fix">
        Allow the ability to specify unidirectional associations without having to specify an aggregation or
        composition end.  The non-navigable end is assumed to be the owning end of the association.
        This fix renders the mappedBy property for OneToOne annotations on the inverse side of the association.
      </action>
      <action dev="vancek" due-to="sverker" type="fix">
        JIRA EJB-40 - Fix support for modelling map associations ends.
        "The attached patch solves this issue as well as providing an improvement in regards to List associations. 
        If no OrderBy tagged value is provided, the IndexColumn annotation is used (hibernate extension) to provide 
        true list association." - The hibernate annotation needs to be switched depending on the persistence
        provider.  This will be fixed once a namespace property is introduced along the lines of
        persistenceProvider.

        JIRA EJB-42 - Fix IllegalStateException "it is illegal to inject UserTransaction into a CMT bean" where a 
        session bean is modelled with bean managed transactions.  This fix sets the <b>transaction-type</b>
        for the session to <b>Bean</b> instead of <b>Container</b>.  This does not affect manageable entity session
