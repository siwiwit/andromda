The samples illustrate the use of AndroMDA with Maven.  To build
the samples, just type 'maven' from this directory.  Both
the Animal Quiz and Car Rental System show typical
AndroMDA project structures.  The Animal Quiz is the most
current sample, you should be able to easily use that as 
a template for your AndroMDA project.  It's also possible
to build an Ant based project with AndroMDA by using the
<andromda> ant task. (although Maven is recommended). 

Good Luck!
