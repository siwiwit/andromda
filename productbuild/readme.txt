If you type "ant" in this directory, the whole AndroMDA distribution will be built. The resulting zip files will appear inside a subdirectory "dist".

Prerequisite:
* In each directory where a build.properties.sample file resides, copy this to build.properties and edit it to match your environment.

Good luck!
