If you type "ant" in this directory, the whole AndroMDA distribution will be built. 
The resulting zip files will appear inside a subdirectory "dist".

Prerequisite:
* copy the build.properties.sample file in this directory to the file build.properties 
* and then edit it to reflect your particular environment.

Good luck!
