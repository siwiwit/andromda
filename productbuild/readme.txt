This directory is useful only in the context of the CVS module andromda-all.
If you want to build the entire andromda project then issue a 'cvs co andromda-all' and it will
contain this directory's contents.

Instructions for Maven1:

1) Install the latest version of Maven 1.0.x (http://maven.apache.org/maven-1.x) and add it to your $PATH.
2) Set the MAVEN_OPTS: "export MAVEN_OPTS=-XX:MaxPermSize=128m\ -Xmx512m"
3) cd to andromda-all, type 'maven', this will build the entire distribution
   without documentation.  Check the target/distributions directory from the resulting output.

P.S. If you only want to build the documentation, just type 'maven docs' and
     the docs will be added the the distribution in the target/distributions directory.

NOTE: When you build any distribution, all jars (or 'artifacts' as Maven calls them) will be
      installed into your local repository as well.



Instructions for Maven2:

1) Install the latest version of Maven 2.0.x (http://maven.apache.org) and add it to your $PATH.
2) Set the MAVEN_OPTS: "export MAVEN_OPTS=-XX:MaxPermSize=128m\ -Xmx512m"
3) cd to andromda-all, type "mvn -N antrun:run", this will install the required archive maven plugins
   (NOTE: this step only needs to be performed the first time you build with a fresh repository).
4) Next type "mvn", this will proceed to build the entire distribution, which can be found in the
   directory: distribution/target


Good luck!
