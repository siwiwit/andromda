    AndroMDA is an open-source MDA framework distributed under the BSD license.
    Go to http://www.andromda.org/ for more information.

    The project located in this directory has been generated by $author
    using the andromdapp:generate Maven plugin.

    You should at least be running Maven 2.0.10 if you want to build your
    project without any Maven-related problems, below is a summary of what has
    been generated and a list of example goals to call from the command line.
    Version 2.0.10 has the fewest known significant bugs.
    More info on maven is available at http://maven.apache.org.
    An excellent guide (Better Builds with Maven) pdf download is available at
    http://www.devzuz.com/web/guest/products/resources#BBWM.

    The standard lifecycle goals (each goal depends on all previous goals) are:
    generate-sources, process-sources, compile, generate-test-*, test-compile,
    test, package, install, deploy. install is the default goal.

    If you want to import each subdirectory into Eclipse as an individual project,
    follow the instructions in mda/eclipse.bat. The pom.xml files are set up for this
    option to work by default.

    The generated project structure is well-tailored for use in the development
    of J2EE projects. The build process itself makes use of Maven, dependencies
    and often-used goals have been added for your convenience.

    Custom configuration can be done by updating the root pom.xml file.
    pom.xml files in directories under the root inherit the root configuration.

#if ($modelType.equals("uml2"))
    Magic Draw 11.5 (or above) is supported via its 'Export to EMF-UML2' feature. You'll notice
    that the andromda.xml is already configured to load these exported files. It expects
    that a model called '$applicationId' has been created within your Magic Draw model.

    Important: before launching AndroMDA, be sure to have exported your model.

#elseif ($modelType.equals("rsm6") || $modelType.equals("rsm7"))
    RSM7 and RSM75 and RSM8 are supported by AndroMDA 3.4-SNAPSHOT. To use an existing model with a generated project:
    - Modify mda/src/main/config/andromda.xml to point to the emx model file (only a single file is supported
    per AndroMDA project)
    - Add a RSM pathmap entry (Preferences -> Modeling) for m2repository pointing to the maven repository directory
    - Add AndroMDA profiles to the model by browsing the maven pepository under org/andromda/profiles/emf/uml2
    - Add the AndroMDA Datatype reference to the project through Project -> Import Model Library.
    - Mark up the model with the appropriate stereotypes and generate code.
    RSM7.x/8.x is supported by default. To use RSM6, modify the dependencies commented in
    M2_REPO/org/andromda/maven/plugins/andromda-maven-plugin/3.4-SNAPSHOT/andromda-maven-plugin-3.4-SNAPSHOT.pom
    to point to emf-uml2 instead of emf-uml22

    In order to succesfully build your project you will need to know
    how to invoke the build process for the existing modules, here's a
    list of examples:

    Please note that you may use the '-o' flag at any time to avoid
    having Maven downloading any SNAPSHOT dependencies.

        %> mvn

            simply builds all modules

        %> mvn -o

            builds all modules in offline mode - does not check remote repositories for updates or downloads

        %> mvn -Peclipse

            builds all modules and updates the .project and .classpath files (Eclipse project information).
            Must be used after dependency changes.

        %> mvn -Dmaven.test.skip=true

            builds all modules and skips all automatic tests (i.e. surefire expected/actual)

        %> mvn -Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=true

            builds all modules and run all automatic tests but does not stop if a test failure

        %> mvn -Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=true

            builds all modules and run all automatic tests but does not stop if a test failure

#if ($ear)
        %> mvn -f app/pom.xml -Ddeploy
#else
        %> mvn -f web/pom.xml -Ddeploy
#end

            collects all artifacts and builds a deployable .$applicationType which is then
            deployed

        %> mvn clean

            cleans (recursively removes) all files from each target directory

        %> mvn -f mda/pom.xml install

            Generates the source files, without compilation or deployment. Or run 'mvn install' from the mda subdirectory.

        %> mvn -Ddeploy

            rebuilds the entire application and deploys

        %> mvn -Denv=prod

            builds the entire application for the production environment, possible 'env' property values
            are 'prod' for production, 'val' for validation and 'dev' for development; not specifying
            any value for this property will build the application for the local configuration
            (more info at http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-profiles.html)

        %> mvn -f web/pom.xml andromdapp:undeploy -o

            undeploys the $applicationType from your app server

        %> mvn -N andromdapp:build -Dmodules=core (or mvn -f core/pom.xml)

            only build the core module

#if ($workflow)
        %> mvn -N andromdapp:build -Dmodules=workflow (or mvn -f workflow/pom.xml)

            only build the workflow module

#end
#if ($web)
        %> mvn -N andromdapp:build -Dmodules=web (or mvn -f web/pom.xml)

            only build the web module

#end
        %>  mvn -f core/pom.xml org.andromda.maven.plugins:andromdapp-maven-plugin:schema -Dtasks=create

            generates the DDL create code and subsequently tells the database
            to create the schema for the entities under app/target/schema*.sql

        %> mvn -f core/pom.xml org.andromda.maven.plugins:andromdapp-maven-plugin:schema -Dtasks=drop

            generates the DDL drop code and subsequently tells the database
            to drop the schema for the entities

        %> mvn -f core/pom.xml org.andromda.maven.plugins:andromdapp-maven-plugin:schema -Dtasks=drop,create

            generates the drop and create DDL code and subsequently tells the database
            to drop and then create the schema for the entities

        %> mvn -f core/pom.xml org.andromda.maven.plugins:andromdapp-maven-plugin:schema -Dtasks=update

            attempts to update the database schema with incremental changes, might not work with all JDBC drivers
            see http://www.hibernate.org/hib_docs/v3/reference/en/html_single/#toolsetguide-s1-6

        %> mvn -f core/pom.xml org.andromda.maven.plugins:andromdapp-maven-plugin:schema -Dtasks=validate

            validates the current Hibernate mappings against the database, you can also use this to simply
            check whether or not the mappings have been properly generated (in case of customizations)

        %> mvn -N andromdapp:build -Dmodules=mda:[andromda:start-server] (or mvn -f mda/pom.xml andromda:start-server)

            starts the AndroMDA server, with this server running you will be able
            to significantly speedup the generation process although it will require
            you to use another console while it is running

        %> mvn -N andromdapp:build -Dmodules=mda:[andromda:stop-server] (or mvn -f mda/pom.xml andromda:stop-server)

            stops the AndroMDA server

        %> mvn -N andromdapp:build -Dmodules=mda (or mvn -f mda/pom.xml)

            runs AndroMDA on your model and thereby generating files in
            the subdirectories of the existing modules

        %> mvn -N andromdapp:build -Dmodules=mda -Dfilter=java,hibernate (or mvn -f mda/pom.xml -Dfilter=java,hibernate)

            runs AndroMDA, but this time only using the Java and Hibernate
            cartridges (in that order)

        %> mvn -N andromdapp:build -Dmodules=mda -Dfilter=~java,hibernate (or mvn -f mda/pom.xml -Dfilter=~java,hibernate)

            runs AndroMDA, but this time using all cartridges *except*
            the Java and Hibernate cartridges

#if ($ear)
        %> mvn -N andromdapp:build -Dmodules=mda,core,web,app -Dfilter=java -Ddeploy
#else
        %> mvn -N andromdapp:build -Dmodules=mda,core,web -Dfilter=java -Ddeploy
#end

            runs AndroMDA using only the Java cartridge, rebuilds the core
            module and web module and deploys afterwards

        %> mvn -N andromdapp:build -Dconsole

            runs the AndroMDApp build goal in 'console' mode, once running, this allows you to execute any goal or subproject
            goal in the manner described above without having to specify the andromdapp:build goal or
            restarting maven (i.e. you can run the mda goal by typing 'mda', build the core module by type 'core', etc).

        %> mvn compile:compile

            compile all sources

        %> mvn process-sources

            generates and compiles all sources from the model(s) without installing/deploying

    Each module will install its artifact into the local Maven repository,
    this might be a directory looking like this:

        (Windows)
        C:\Documents and Settings\${author}\.m2\repository\${applicationId}\

        (*nix)
        /home/${author}/.m2/repository/${applicationId}/

    Good luck!
