            <p>
               Before you start modeling your application front-end you will want to think about
               how to split the application in different <em>use-cases</em>. Each use-case should define
               a unique set of processing logic operations that are specific to your application.
               Typical use-cases are: 'Login', 'Place order', 'Add new user'.
               No two use-cases should have the same name.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the sake of simplicity our application will consist of only a single use-case.
                Adding other use-cases is very straightforward and should not present any problems.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's call our use-case <code>Purchase Items</code>. As you can see it is not a problem
                to have spaces in the name. We will put in a suitable package, and label it with the
                <![CDATA[<<FrontEndUseCase>>]]> stereotype.
            </p>
            <p class="highlight">
                It is mandatory to inform the cartridge which use-cases will be considered to be the
                application's entry point, this use-case must be labeled with the
                <![CDATA[<<FrontEndApplication>>]]> stereotype. One and only one use-case must be labeled this way.
            </p>

            <p>
                The next step is to specify in detail how our application's presentation layer
                is going to behave, this is done by means of an <a href="howto2.html">activity graph</a>
