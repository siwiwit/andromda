        <section name="Activity Graphs">
            <p>
               These graphs allow you to express the way you want your application to behave, this is expressed
               by means of states and transitions. An activity graph therefore, by definition, is a
               <em>state machine</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your activity graph should be modeled as a child element of the use-case. In case your modeling
                tool does not support that you can add a tagged value to the use-case, making it point to the
                activity graph, like this: <code>@andromda.struts.usecase.activity=My Activity Graph</code>
            </p>
            <p>
                On this page you will see how to use the different states, and how to express the flow from one
                state into another.
            </p>
            <p class="highlight">
                Custom code (methods) can be executed from an action state, you will learn about that in one of the
                later sections, click <a href="howto4.html">here</a> to immediately go there.

            <subsection name="Initial States">
                <p>
                    Each use-case needs an <code>initial state</code>, an initial state is displayed as
                    a solid black disc. It denotes the starting point of the use-case, it can have no incoming
                    transitions and only one outgoing transition. Only a single initial state is allowed
                    per activity graph.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since our example features only one use-case it will therefore
                    contain exactly one initial state.
                </p>

            <subsection name="Action States">
                <p>
                    An action state represents a certain state in which the application can be recorded,
                    an action state is displayed as a rectangle with rounded corners. In bpm4struts you will
                    use action states for both server-side states (the controller: struts actions)
                    as client-side states (the view: JSP, VTL, ...).
                </p>
                <p class="highlight">
                    Make sure the actual name property of each action state is unique in the activity graph.
                    Additionally, make sure the name is properly entered: sometimes people enter the action state's
                    <em>label</em> in the activity diagram instead of the real name of the element.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Client-side action states are tagged with the <![CDATA[<<FrontEndView>>]]> stereotype,
                    they represent a JSP and may have multiple outgoing transitions (one per call
                    to the server). It is not allowed to model a transition between two <![CDATA[<<FrontEndView>>]]>
                    action states.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Server-side action states do not need any stereotype but can only have a single outgoing
                    transition.

            <subsection name="Transitions">
                <p>
                    Transitions are used to interconnect the different states in the activity graph, they make up
                    the actual process logic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A few tagged values exist for transitions coming out of <![CDATA[<<FrontEndView>>]]> action states,
                    please see this page to learn more about them:
                    <a href="modeling.html#Supported_Tagged_Values">modeling.html</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is possible to model exceptions to the process logic, in doing so you express how the system
                    should behave in case something goes wrong. You just need to add the
                    <![CDATA[<<FrontEndException>>]]> stereotype to the transition and you're good. Additionally
                    you can add a tagged value to such a transition in order to refine the exception handling:
                    <code>@andromda.struts.exception.type</code> needs the fully qualified classname of the exception
                    to be handled by this transition, others will be ignored; the default value if not specified is
                    <code>java.lang.Exception</code> meaning all exceptions will be handled.
                </p>
                <p class="highlight">
                    The default exception handling strategy is to return to the source page on which
                    the exception has been triggered.
                </p>
            </subsection>
            <subsection name="Action Parameters">
                <p>
                    Action parameters are parameters modeled on transitions exiting client-side action states
                    (the ones with the <![CDATA[<<FrontEndView>>]]> stereotype). Whenever you model such a transition
                    it represents a call to the server from a webpage, usually by sumbitting a form. The parameters
                    you model will represent the form fields.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please note that you will need to add the parameters to the transition's <code>trigger</code>,
                    this trigger should be of type 'signal', but don't worry about that if your UML tool does
                    not support setting the type of the trigger.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Different tagged values exist to control the generation of the type of the action parameter.

                                Action parameters can be made selectable so that the user can select one or more values
                                from a list and send them to the server. In order to achieve this we need to make the
                                distinction between two types of data: the complete list and the selected value(s).
                            </p>

                                The action parameter you model should represent the one that is sent to the server,
                                this typically is a String but could also be a Collection, List, int, etc...
                                Add the following tagged value to this parameter:
                                <code>@andromda.struts.view.field.type=select</code>.
                            </p>

                                A collection-type parameter (Collection, List, Set, ...) will result in the rendering
                                of a list where multiple selections are possible.

                                Adding this tagged value will allow us to populate this list prior to showing it to
                                the user.

                                will have the possiblity to populate the list. In order to do this you would simply
                                defer to a controller operation which has as argument a parameter with the exact same
                                name and type as the action parameter, defer to this operation somewhere <em>before</em>
                                entering the <![CDATA[<<FrontEndView>>]]> action state. This will result in
                                the controller having the possiblity to set the values and labels for the
                                selectable field.

                                the selectable action parameter. In this case the action parameter had been named
                                <code>'number'</code>. Most of the time the data that will go into the list is coming
                                from the back-end, in this example the list contents never change.

                <p>
                    Page variables are modeled the same way action parameters are, the only difference is that
                    you model them on transitions <em>entering</em> a <![CDATA[<<FrontEndView>>]]> action state.
                    In doing so the modeled parameters will be available in the generated JSP page.

                <p>
                    Page variables can be rendered in tabular format, this is an advanced feature which
                    is explained in more depth on this page:
                    <a href="howto8.html">Tables</a>.

            </subsection>
            <subsection name="Decision Points">
                <p>
                    In some cases action states and transitions just aren't enough, a good example is when you
                    want to fork the flow based on a specific decision. Suppose you want to follow the first
                    transition if the user login credentials are valid, and follow the second transition if they
                    are invalid.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to do this we must need to be able to call an operation with a return value, on which
                    the decision is based. We will see how to do this later, click here
                    to proceed there now: <a href="howto4">Custom Code</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally we must tag the transition indicating when it must be followed, in UML this is done
                    by means of <em>guards</em>. Not to make things overly complex it is not necessary to model
                    the OCL for the guard (very few tools properly support this), so instead it will be sufficient
                    to model the name of the guard, it must match the return value of the method call
                    (matching is done using <code>String.valueOf(returnValue)</code>).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some modeling tools do not properly show the name of the guard in the activity diagram, in that
                    case you might consider copying the name also in the guard's body, this will be ignored by the
                    cartridge and might show it on screen for clarity.

                <p>
                    You may have as many final states as you want in an activity graph. In bpm4struts a final state
                    represents the end of the use-case and the flow into the next use-case. Final states are
                    displayed as bulls-eyes in activity diagrams.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are two ways of modeling a final state: either you give it the name of the next use-case
                    (which can be the same as the current use-case), either you do not name it and you use a hyperlink
                    to the next use-case (this is not supported in all UML tools).

                    Each action state carrying the <![CDATA[<<FrontEndView>>]]> stereotype will result in the generation
                    of a JSP page. If you have properly modeled your use-case then these pages will contain
                    already everything to have a working application: forms, buttons,
                    hyperlinks, a menu, breadcrumbs, an online help, client validation, server calls, security ...
                </p>
                <p>
                    The generated JSP pages comply to the JSP 2.0 specification, as found in J2EE 1.4.

            <subsection name="Struts Actions/Forms">
                <p>
                    For each transition modeled exiting either an initial state or an action state with the
                    <![CDATA[<<FrontEndView>>]]> stereotype the cartridge will generate a Struts Action class
                    and a Struts Form class. The parameters modeled on the transition's signal event
                    will make up the fields that go into the form.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The generated <code>struts-config.xml</code> descriptor will contain a <code>form-bean</code>
                    entry per generated Form. Here's an example:
<source><![CDATA[
<form-beans>
    ...
    <form-bean
        name="purchaseItemsEnterUserDetailsPurchaseForm"
        type="my.onlinestore.purchase.EnterUserDetailsPurchaseForm" />
    ...
</form-beans>
]]></source>
                </p>
                <p>
                     Each action will have a corresponding
                    <code>action-mapping</code> entry, like this:
<source><![CDATA[
<action-mappings>
    ...
    <action
        path="/PurchaseItems/EnterUserDetailsPurchase"
        type="my.onlinestore.purchase.EnterUserDetailsPurchase"

        unknown="false"
        validate="true">
        <exception
            type="java.lang.Exception"
            key="purchase.items.enter.user.details.exception"
            path="/my/onlinestore/purchase/enter-user-details.jsp"
            scope="request" />
        <forward
            name="purchase.items"
            path="/PurchaseItems/PurchaseItems.do"
            redirect="false" />

    ...
</action-mappings>
]]></source>

                <p>
                    The generated web application perfectly supports i18n, this way your application can be used
                    in many different languages. A file called <code>application-resources.properties</code>
                    is auto-generated by the application and will contain label-value pairs in the language
                    in which the application has been modeled.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Add you own languages by simply translating the generated resource bundle.
                    Custom label-value pairs can
                    be added easily in a file called <code>custom-resources.properties</code>, this file is
                    generated too.

                                    The password confirmation is also automatically rendered into the page using
                                    JavaScript (server-side validation will also be performed). The tooltip is shown
                                    when hovering over an input field, in this case the password field. Also notice the
                                    online-help link at the bottom of the screen.
