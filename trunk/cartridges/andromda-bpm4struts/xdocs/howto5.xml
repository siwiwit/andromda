            <p>
                Sometimes it is interesting to have the possibility of storing data in the session scope,
                this can be hard to maintain in the long run though. Therefore the bpm4struts allows you
                to nicely model the objects that are stored in session scope.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's very simple, just model a new class and add the <![CDATA[<<FrontEndSessionObject>>]]> stereotype
                to it. Next, you will add attributes to that class, make sure all these attributes are <em>public</em>
                or you won't have any accessors generated for them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, just draw a dependency from any <a href="howto3.html">controller class</a>
                to the session object, this will generate an accessor in the controller, so it's very easy
                to start using the session object (it will be created if it does not yet exist etc...).
            </p>
            <p>
                A controller class may be dependent on more than one session object, and a session object may be
                shared between controller classes.
