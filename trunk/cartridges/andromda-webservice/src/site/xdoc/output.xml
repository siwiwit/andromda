        <section name="Output Projects and Files">
            <p>
                Code that is generated once and not overwritten is under /src, code that is generated and overwritten 
                each time is under /target/src. There are also .ref (reference) files for artifacts that would have been
                generated if the existing file was not there. They can be used for comparison/merging purposes, i.e. if 
                a new method is added to the model and the stubbed implementation must also be added to the Impl class.
            </p>
            <p>
                Projects are generated in the following order: mda, common, core, webservice, app (if ear), CXF. Code that is generated once and not overwritten is under /src, code that is generated and overwritten each time is under /target/src. The process looks like:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Read model(s) and generate code from andromda</li>
                <li>(mda) Run webservice\buildWS.xml, which validates and runs wsdl2java against each generated service wsdl targeting the CXF project, and copies ObjectFactory and faults back to the common project</li>
                <li>Compiles common project</li>
                <li>Compiles core project and runs local unit tests against the service implementation delegates</li>
                <li>Compiles webservice project.</li>
                <li>(webservice) Launches Jetty with the generated Spring configuration. Runs integration tests with in-place war project against java client. Stops Jetty.</li>
                <li>Runs java2ws against the common/core generated code, targeting the CXF project. This verifies that the java service implementation code can be used to create compatible wsdl and will display the proper result when using ?wsdl URL</li>
                <li>Copies spring/web configuration from webservice project. Compiles CXF project</li>
                <li>(CXF) Launches Jetty with the generated Spring configuration. Runs integration tests with in-place war project against java client. Stops Jetty. This verifies that server and client code generated by CXF against the wsdl is valid</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>build.xml: ant build script to generate code through maven and generate wsdl and java code in the CXF project.
                Created by the andromdapp initial project generation. 
                buildAll iterates through multiple models and calls build.xml tasks (Deprecated â€“ no longer needed after multi-model code generation was fixed).</li>
                <li>src/main/config/andromda.xml: the master configuration for code generation. 
                Specifies model file(s), cartridges, and generation options</li>
                <li>src/main/config/mappings: Configuration files to override default mappings from UML to Java, 
                or UML to XML, configured in andromda.xml. By default we override XMLDate behavior.</li>
                <li>src/main/uml: default location for model(s) used for code generation.</li>
                <li>logs: log files are initially generated in the root directory, and copied to the logs 
                directory at the start of the next run. Logging level is changed by uncommenting the log4j.xml reference in andromda.xml.</li>
                <li>Runs the generated buildWS.xml ant script in the webservice project, which runs wsdl2java against the generated wsdl/xsd
                with output to the CXF project, and copies some files (such as ObjectFactory and *Fault) back to the common and core projects.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                the ant output looks something like this:
