Describes how Android projects are made up and describes the colaborators.

---+++ Android Projects
An Android project is just a normal Java project which has an AndroidNature so it can be distinguished from other, non-android projects.
Another reason why we need the notion of an Android project is that we somehow need to define the structure of an AndroMDA project. Of course, most AndroMDA projects have a layout similar to the one created by the application generator, but users are free to set up their projects with a different layout. The following files and directories are crucial to an AndroMDA project:
   * andromda.xml - the config file
   * the model
   * the source directory - home of the java files
   * the target directory - where the compiler places .class files

---+++ Design considerations
   * AndroidProject has methods to return the core artifacts such as ==andromds.xml== and so on.
   * AndroidProjectLayoutPropertyPage displays location configuration for the current project. The property _Enable project specific settings_ is deactivated normally, so each project will use global settings. Users can select _Enable project specific settings_ in order to configure project specific settings.
   * Global settings can be defined on the AndroidProjectLayoutPreferencesPage view.
   * Look and feel of these pages akin to the _Java Compiler_ settings.
   * AndroidProjectLayoutDetector will try to detect locations of the crucial files and directories
