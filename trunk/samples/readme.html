<title>Andromda Samples</title>
</head>
<body>
The samples illustrate the use of AndroMDA with Maven.  
Both the Animal Quiz and Car Rental System show typical
AndroMDA project structures. 
<p>
Provided in this
distribution is a maven plugin, you can use this
plugin to generate your own application having the 
same structure as these samples.  To run it, just install
the plugin into your $MAVEN_HOME/plugins directory (copy the
file maven-andromdapp-plugin-[VERSION-NAME].jar).  
In the directory where you would like your project directory
created enter 'maven andromdapp:generate'.  
<p>
It's also possible to build an Ant based project with AndroMDA by 
using the &#60;andromda&#62;. ant task (although its currently not shown in the
samples).
<p>
The following instructions assume you are familiar with operating
a JBoss system.
<p>
To build the samples, perform the following steps:
<ol>
<li>Install the latest version of <a href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven</a>
 and add it to your $PATH or %PATH%
<li>From this directory (the directory in which this file you're reading is located) type 'maven'; 
this will build all samples.  After the build has completed successfully,
follow the instructions for each sample below.
</ol>
<p>   
NOTE: After you've built the samples the first time, you can build them again 
      with the '-o' parameter passed to maven.  (i.e. you can
      type 'maven -o').  The '-o' tells Maven to build offline and since
      it isn't trying to download the dependencies, it will build much faster.

<h2>OnlineStore application.</h2>
To run:
<ol>
<li>Copy the app/target/ ear file to [JBOSS_HOME]/server/[SERVER_NAME]/deploy
<li>[Re]Start JBoss.
<li>Open <a href="http://localhost:8080/OnlineStore">Local OnlineStore</a>
<li>The first page expects the user to enter his name and password, his
name must be at least 3 characters and start with a capital, the password
needs to be 6 characters or more and consists of alphanumerical characters

<h2>AnimalQuiz Sample</h2>
To run:
<ol>
<li>Copy the app/target/ ear file to [JBOSS_HOME]/server/[SERVER_NAME]/deploy
<li>Check that HSQLDB TCP connnections are enabled. 
Edit [JBOSS_HOME]/server/[SERVER_NAME]/deploy/hsqldb-ds.xml
and uncomment two pragmas, one for the connection and one for the mbean.
<li>[Re]Start JBoss as neccessary.
<li>Change directory to the animal-quiz/app/target and 
execute the initializeSchema.[sh|cmd] script.
<li>Open <a href="http://localhost:8080/AnimalQuiz">Local AnimalQuiz</a>

Edit [JBOSS_HOME]/server/[SERVER_NAME]/deploy/hsqldb-ds.xml
and uncomment two pragmas, one for the connection and one for the mbean.
<li>[Re]Start JBoss as neccessary.
<li>Change directory to the cd car-rental-system/app/hibernate/target and 
execute the initializeSchema.[sh|cmd] script.
<li>Open <a href="http://localhost:8080/carrental-ejb">Local EJB Car Rental System</a> or
