8. SFTP transfer file from local directory to remote:
sftp> put site.zip
9. From the SSH shell session, unzip the contents to the htdocs directory:

[bobfields@shell-24004 andromda]$ unzip
UnZip 6.00 of 20 April 2009, by Info-ZIP.  Maintained by C. Spieler.  Send
bug reports using http://www.info-zip.org/zip-bug.html; see README for details.

Usage: unzip [-Z] [-opts[modifiers]] file[.zip] [list] [-x xlist] [-d exdir]
  Default action is to extract files in list, except those in xlist, to exdir;
  file[.zip] may be a wildcard.  -Z => ZipInfo mode ("unzip -Z" for usage).

  -p  extract files to pipe, no messages     -l  list files (short format)
  -f  freshen existing files, create none    -t  test compressed archive data
  -u  update files, create if necessary      -z  display archive comment only
  -v  list verbosely/show version info       -T  timestamp archive to latest
  -x  exclude files that follow (in xlist)   -d  extract files into exdir
modifiers:
  -n  never overwrite existing files         -q  quiet mode (-qq => quieter)
  -o  overwrite files WITHOUT prompting      -a  auto-convert any text files
  -j  junk paths (do not make directories)   -aa treat ALL files as text
  -U  use escapes for all non-ASCII Unicode  -UU ignore any Unicode fields
  -C  match filenames case-insensitively     -L  make (some) names lowercase
  -X  restore UID/GID info                   -V  retain VMS version numbers
  -K  keep setuid/setgid/tacky permissions   -M  pipe through "more" pager
See "unzip -hh" or unzip.txt for more help.  Examples:
  unzip data1 -x joe   => extract all files except joe from zipfile data1.zip
  unzip -p foo | more  => send contents of foo.zip via pipe into program more
  unzip -fo foo ReadMe => quietly replace existing ReadMe if archive file newer

Basic unzip command line:
  unzip [-Z] options archive[.zip] [file ...] [-x xfile ...] [-d exdir]

Some examples:
  unzip -l foo.zip        - list files in short format in archive foo.zip
  unzip -t foo            - test the files in archive foo
  unzip -Z foo            - list files using more detailed zipinfo format
  unzip foo               - unzip the contents of foo in current dir
  unzip -a foo            - unzip foo and convert text files to local OS

[bobfields@shell-24004 andromda]$ unzip -aoq site.zip -d htdocs

9A.? chmod 664 *

10. Test that site is updated correctly - navigate to http://andromda.sourceforge.net/index.html

11. Copy site.zip to /home/frs/project/a/an/andromda/1. andromda V3.x/andromda-docs-3.5.zip

To publish the site using maven...
1. Add login information to your local maven settings.xml 'id,andromda' as the ID (note the comma in the id value)
2. Run 'mvn site -Plocal,andromda-site-light' locally to create a local version of the site under /target/site, so that the site does not have to be created during the deployment process. This takes me about an hour. Verify the site documentation and links are correct after creation.
3. Create a temporary shell for yourself with 'ssh -t <username>,andromda@shell.sf.net create'. You have 240 minutes after creation to complete all SCP operations as part of the build before the shell goes away (you see a 'connection refused' error from the SCP build).
4. Log into the remote shell from another prompt using 'ssh <username>,andromda@shell.sf.net'. If you get an error message about the authenticity of the host, type 'yes'. This adds the host name and SSH key to the file ~user/.ssh/known_hosts (%USERPROFILE% in Windows), to avoid this prompt in the future. Connect (once) to the same shell using @shell.sourceforge.net, that's a host alias but the authenticity error shows up for that host name in addition to shell.sf.net. Maven does not propagate this prompt but apparently does update the known_hosts file. I've done this several times but still get the authenticity error below.
5. Run 'mvn site:deploy -Psourceforge,andromda-lite > sourceforge.log' (I use a log to check and record progress)
6. If you see the following error, type 'yes' on the command line (see https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/sourceforge/wiki/SCP#Authentication):
[INFO] --- maven-site-plugin:3.1:deploy (default-cli) @ andromda ---
The authenticity of host 'shell.sourceforge.net' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is 80:1c:ee:50:14:cd:ef:28:3e:82:c6:ef:44:55:d7:74.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting? (yes/no): scp://shell.sourceforge.net/home/project-web/andromda/htdocs/
7. Deployment will run a very long time, it does zip/scp/unzip/chmod for 144 projects in the hierarchy. chmod runs against the entire hierarchy under htdocs, every time a project directory is uploaded.
8. When complete, verify the site with http://andromda.sourceforge.net/index.html. https does not work, it gives an 'interrupted while the page was loading' error message.
