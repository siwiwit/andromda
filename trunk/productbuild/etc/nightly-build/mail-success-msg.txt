Hello AndroMDA Developer,

I have just finished today's "nightly" build and I have emailed
you the output in attachment, I am happy to report that everything went fine.

In addition I have published the latest docs online and copied the generated
artifacts into the Maven repository on the team server.

The distribution is also available online, both the source and the binary.
