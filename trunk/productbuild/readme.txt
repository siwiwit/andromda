This directory is useful only in the context of the CVS module andromda-all.
If you want to build the entire andromda project then issue a 'cvs co andromda-all' and it will
contain this directory's contents.

Instructions:
1) Install the latest version of Maven (http://maven.apache.org) and add it to your $PATH
2) Create a build.properties file and add:
  'maven.repo.remote=http://www.ibibilio.org/maven,http://team.andromda.org/maven' 
   and place in your %USERPROFILE% (windows), or $HOME (linux/unix) directory.
3) cd to andromda-all, type just type 'maven dist', this will build the entire distribution
   including documentation.  Check the target/distributions directory from the resulting output.

P.S. If you only want to build without the documentation, just type 'maven dist-bin' and
     only the binary distribution will be created. 
     
NOTE: When you build any distribution, all jars (or 'artifacts' as Maven calls them) will be 
      installed into your local repository as well.

Good luck!
