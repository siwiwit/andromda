This directory is useful only in the context of the CVS module andromda-all.
If you want to build the entire andromda project then issue a 'cvs co andromda-all' and it will
contain this directory's contents.

If you type "ant" in this directory (in the context of the CVS module andromda-all), the
whole AndroMDA distribution will be built. The resulting zip files will appear inside a
subdirectory "dist".

Prerequisite:
* copy the build.properties.sample file in this directory to the file build.properties
* then edit it to reflect your particular environment.

Good luck!
