        We have now covered the key concepts needed to use AndroMDA. You may wish to complete

        wanted to write! Having mastered AndroMDA, you now have a powerful tool to take
        on the most challenging applications ahead of you. Not only will you complete them
        successfully, but you will also complete them with greater speed and quality.
