    <h2>Application Architecture</h2>
    <!------------------------- Intro Text ------------------------->
    <p>
        Modern enterprise applications are built using several components connected to one
        another, each providing a specific functionality. Components that perform similar
        functions are generally grouped into layers. These layers are further organized
        as a stack where components in a higher layer use the services of components in
        a lower layer. A component in a given layer will generally use the functionality
        of other components in its own layer or the layers below it. The diagram below shows
        a popular layer structure for an enterprise application.

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Presentation Layer:</strong> The presentation layer contains components
            needed to interact with the user of the application. Examples of such components
            are web pages, rich-client forms, user interaction process components etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Business Layer:</strong> The business layer encapsulates the core business
            functionality of the application. Simple business functions can be implemented using
            stateless components, whereas complex, long-running transactions can be implemented
            using stateful workflows. The business components are generally front-ended by a
            service interface that acts as a facade to hide the complexity of the business logic.
            This is commonly known as Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA).</li>
        <li><strong>Data Access Layer:</strong> The data access layer provides a simple API
            for accessing and manipulating data. The components in this layer abstract the semantics
            of the underlying data access technology thus allowing the business layer to focus
            on business logic. Each component typically provides methods to perform Create,
            Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for a specific business entity.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Stores:</strong> Enterprise applications store their data in one or
            more data stores. Databases and file systems are two very common types of data stores.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Note that layers are simply logical groupings of components that make up an application.
        How these layers are actually deployed on physical machines, however, can vary widely
        depending on several factors. In the simplest case, all the layers can reside on
        one machine. In a slightly more complex scenario, the presentation layer can reside
        on one machine, the business and data access layers on a second machine, and the
        database on a third machine. More elaborate scenarios are possible; for example,
        a high traffic web site can deploy the presentation layer on a web farm consisting
        of tens of machines.

    <h3>Architecture of AndroMDA Generated Applications</h3>
    <p>
        Now that we understand the basic concepts behind modern enterprise applications,
        let's discuss how AndroMDA implements these concepts. AndroMDA takes as its input
        a business model specified in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) and generates
        significant portions of the layers needed to build a Java application. AndroMDA's
        ability to automatically translate high-level business specifications into production
        quality code results in significant time savings when implementing Java applications.
        The diagram below maps various application layers to Java technologies supported
        by AndroMDA.
    </p>
    <p>

        <!-- img src="Images/net_arch.jpg" alt="Java Application Architecture Diagram" / -->
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Presentation Layer:</strong> AndroMDA currently offers two technology options
            to build web based presentation layers: <a href="http://struts.apache.org/" target="_blank">
                Struts</a> and <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaee/javaserverfaces/" target="_blank">
                    JSF</a>. It accepts UML activity diagrams as input to specify page flows
            and generates Web components that conform to the Struts or JSF frameworks.</li>
        <li><strong>Business Layer:</strong> The business layer generated by AndroMDA consists
            primarily of services that are configured using the <a href="http://www.springframework.org/"
                target="_blank">Spring Framework</a>. These services are implemented manually
            in AndroMDA-generated blank methods, where business logic can be defined. These
            generated services can optionally be front-ended with EJBs, in which case the services
            must be deployed in an EJB container (e.g., <a href="http://labs.jboss.com/portal/jbossas/"
                target="_blank">JBoss</a>). Services can also be exposed as Web Services, providing
            a platform independent way for clients to access their functionality. AndroMDA can
            even generate business processes and workflows for the <a href="http://www.jboss.com/products/jbpm"
                target="_blank">jBPM</a> workflow engine (part of the JBoss product line).</li>
        <li><strong>Data Access Layer:</strong> AndroMDA leverages the popular object-relational
            mapping tool called <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/" target="_blank">Hibernate</a>
            to generate the data access layer for applications. AndroMDA does this by generating
            data access objects (DAOs) for entities defined in the UML model. These data access
            objects use the Hibernate API to convert database records into objects and vice-versa.
            AndroMDA also supports <a href="http://www.jboss.com/products/seam" target="_blank">
                EJB3/Seam</a> for data access layer (pre-relase).</li>
        <li><strong>Data Stores:</strong> Since AndroMDA generated applications use Hibernate
            to access the data, you can use any of the databases supported by Hibernate.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Data Propagation Between Layers</h3>
    <p>
        In addition to the concepts discussed previously, it is important to understand
        how data propagates between various layers of an application. Follow along the diagram
        above as we start from the bottom up.
    </p>
    <p>
        As you know, relational databases store data as records in tables. The data access
        layer fetches these records from the database and transforms them into objects that
        represent entities in the business domain. Hence, these objects are called business
        entities.
    </p>
    <p>
        Going one level up, the data access layer passes the entities to the business layer
        where business logic is performed.
    </p>
    <p>
        The last thing to discuss is the propagation of data between the business layer
        and the presentation layer, for which there are two schools of thought. Some people
        recommend that the presentation layer should be given direct access to business
        entities. Others recommend just the opposite, i.e. business entities should be off
        limits to the presentation layer and that the business layer should package necessary
        information into so-called "value objects" and transfer these value objects to the
        presentation layer. Let's look at the pros and cons of these two approaches.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first approach (entities only, no value objects) is simpler to implement. You
        do not have to create value objects or write any code to transfer information between
        entities and value objects. In fact, this approach will probably work well for simple,
        small applications where the the presentation layer and the service layer run on
        the same machine. However, this approach does not scale well for larger and more
        complex applications. Here's why:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Business logic is no longer contained in the business layer. It is tempting to freely
            manipulate entities in the presentation layer and thus spread the business logic
            in multiple places -- definitely a maintenance nightmare. In case there are multiple
            front-ends to a service, business logic must be duplicated in all these front-ends.
            In addition, there is no protection against the presentation layer corrupting the
            entities - intentionally or unintentionally!</li>
        <li>When the presentation layer is running on a different machine (as in the case of
            a rich client), it is very inefficient to serialize a whole network of entities
            and send it across the wire. Take the example of showing a list of orders to the
            user. In this scenario, you really don't need to transfer the gory details of every
            order to the client application. All you need is perhaps the order number, order
            date and total amount for each order. If the user later wishes to see the details
            of a specific order, you can always serialize that entire order and send it across
            the wire.</li>
        <li>Passing real entities to the client may pose a security risk. Do you want the client
            application to have access to the salary information inside the Employee object
            or your profit margins inside the Order object?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Value objects provide a solution for all these problems. Yes, they require you to
        write a little extra code; but in return, you get a bullet-proof business layer
        that communicates efficiently with the presentation layer. You can think of a value
        object as a controlled view into one or more entities relevant to your client application.
        Note that AndroMDA provides some basic support for translation between entities
        and value objects, as you will see in the tutorial.
    </p>
    <h3>Services and Hibernate Sessions</h3>
    <p>
        Another key concept of AndroMDA-generated applications is the strong association
        between service methods (i.e., operations exposed by a service) and Hibernate sessions.
        But before we introduce this concept, we must lay out some ground work. The Hibernate
        session is a runtime object that allows an application to create, read, update and
        delete entities in the data store. As long as the session is "open", these entities
        are attached to the session and you can navigate from one entity to another using
        relationships between them. If a related entity is not yet in memory, Hibernate
        will automatically pull it in for you (this is called "lazy loading"). However as
        soon you close the Hibernate session, the entities that exist in memory are considered
        to be "detached"; i.e. Hibernate no longer knows about them. You are free to hold
        references to such entities, but Hibernate will no longer pull in associated entities
        if they don't exist in memory already. If you accidentally try to access such associated
        entities, you will get a Hibernate <code>LazyInitializationException</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now that we understand this background material, let us discuss the relationship
        between a service method and a Hibernate session. When a client application calls
        a service method, a new Hibernate session is opened automatically -- you do not
        have to write any code to do this. Similarly, when the service method exits, the
        associated Hibernate session is closed automatically. In other words, the lifespan
        of a Hibernate session is bounded by the beginning and ending of a service method
        call. Consequently, entities are attached to Hibernate session for the entire duration
        of the service call, but are detached from this session as soon as the service call
        ends. As a result, if your service method returns raw entities, the client must
        be extra careful not to access related entities that are not in memory already.
        You can avoid all this mess by following the recommendation in the earlier section;
        that is, transfer all relevant information into value objects while the session
        is still open, and pass these value objects back to your caller as a return value.
        In general, think of a service method as a logical transactional boundary - do everything
        you need to do within the method and then return the results as value objects.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another implication of the strong association between a service method and a Hibernate
        session is that client applications should not try to bypass the service layer and
        interact directly with the lower layers. You may be able to brute force your way
        into one data access object, but sooner or later you will get into trouble!
    </p>
