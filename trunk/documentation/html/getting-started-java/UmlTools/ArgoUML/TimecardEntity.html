    <h2>Create Timecard Entity</h2>
    <!------------------------- Intro Text ------------------------->
    <p>
        This page provides directions to create the <code>Timecard</code> entity using ArgoUML.
        The model is shown below for your reference.
    </p>
    <!------------------------- Main Text ------------------------->
    <table width="100%" border="0">
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <!-- img src="images/Timecard.png" alt="Timecard" / -->
                <td align="center" style="width: 100%">
                    {mosimage}</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
        Follow the steps below to create the <code>Timecard</code> entity along with the
        two associations.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Select the diagram called "Domain Objects" and create a class called <code>Timecard</code>
            in it. Make sure the class is created in the <code>org.andromda.timetracker.domain</code>
            package by inspecting the tree in the explorer pane.</li>
        <li>Set the stereotype of the <code>Timecard</code> class to Entity.</li>
        <li>Add the 3 attributes as shown above.</li>
        <li>Add the <code>findByCriteria()</code> operation as shown above. By default the operation
            is created with instance scope. Click "static" in the Modifiers section of the
            property panel to change it to instance scope.  You can confirm the change by
            checking that the operation name is now underlined on the diagram.</li>
        <li>Select the association tool {mosimage}
            <!-- img src="images/ToolUniAssociation.png" alt="Uni Association Tool" / -->
            from the toolbar. Create an association from <code>Timecard</code> to <code>User</code>.</li>
        <li>Double-click on the 2nd association end in the Connections field and confirm
            that is the correct end by checking that the type is <code>User</code>.  Give it
            the name <code>submitter</code>.  Set the multiplicity to 1.</li>
        <li>Click Other End tool {mosimage}
            <!-- img src="images/ToolOtherEnd.png" alt="Other Association End Tool" / -->
            to select the other end of the association.  Give this end a multiplicity of
            0..1.  It doesn't need a name because it's not navigable and won't be used by code.</li>
        <li>Similarly add an association from <code>Timecard</code> to <code>User</code>. 
            Give the first (from) end a multiplicity of 0..* and the second (to) end
            the name <code>approver</code> and a multiplicity of 0..1. Move the associations 
            up or down as appropriate so they and their labels do not overlap each other.</li>
        <li>Save the model by selecting File&rarr;Save Project.</li>
    </ol>
