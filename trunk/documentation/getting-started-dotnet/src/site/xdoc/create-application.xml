            <p>
                Now that you have your environment setup you can start using AndroMDA in your projects.
                This section will guide you through creating the base TimeTracker solution. These
                are the same steps you would follow when you are starting your own application.
                Please note the TimeTracker completed sample is available here:<a
                    href="Northwind.TimeTracker.zip">
                Northwind.TimeTracker.zip</a>.
            </p>

                Couple of tips before we start:
            </p>

                    entity and
                    some supporting classes were created and added to the model because the membership

        <section name="Creating the TimeTracker Database">

            <p>
                We need to create a database for TimeTracker to store the timecards. While you can
                use any type of database NHibernate supports in your project, this tutorial will
                focus on SQL Server 2000, 2005 and MSDE. Here are the steps to creating a database
                for TimeTracker:
