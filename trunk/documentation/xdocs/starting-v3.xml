            <h3>Maven</h3>
            <p class="std">
                Make sure you have Maven installed
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                Go into a directory in which you want to create your working directory.
                For example, suppose you want to work in C:\development\java\my-project, then
                simple go into C:\development\java\
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                At the console type:
                <source>
                    C:\development\java> maven andromda:genapp
                </source>
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                Answer the questions you are prompted to answer
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                Giving your project the id 'my-project' will create a subdirectory
                with the same name, so you'll have C:\development\java\my-project.
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                C:\development\java\my-project\mda\src\uml will contain an empty XMI
                document, you can use it to get started modelling your application
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                Simply typing 'maven' in C:\development\java\my-project will build your
                application and it will put all the binaries into the local
                Maven repository (most probably this is the .maven directory in your home
                directory)
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                Optionally you can go into a subdirectory to build it separately from
                the others, this is much quicker and it will make it easy to focus on
                only a part of your application.
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                If your application 'my-project' has been built succesfully you can find
                the binaries here: %USERPROFILE%\.maven\repository\my-project\
                (for *nix users: $USER_HOME\.maven\repository\my-project\)
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                By default the application will generate an EJB backend (optionally with a
                Hibernate persistence layer) and a Struts front-end.
            </p>
