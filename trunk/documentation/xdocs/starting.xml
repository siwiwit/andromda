                AndroMDA 2.x and AndroMDA 3.x are used differently, please go to
                their respective documentation page:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="#andromda2">Getting started with AndroMDA 2.x</a></li>

            <p class="std">
        The approach we recommend to getting started with AndroMDA is to
                <b>learn it</b>,
                <b>see it</b>, and
                <b>do it</b>.
            </p>

            <p class="std">
                <b>Learn it</b>
            </p>

            <p class="std">
         The first step is to review the web pages under the section
                <b>For Users</b>.
         A quick review of the concepts and some of the parts of AndroMDA will get you
         acquainted enough with the AndroMDA landscape so that you will understand what
         is happening when you see it in action.
            </p>

            <p class="std">
         If there is something you do not immediately understand, don't worry
         too much. It'll all become clear once you've built your own model and generated
         code from it.
            </p>

            <p class="std">
                <b>See It</b>
            </p>

            <p class="std">
         After a brief review of the basics of AndroMDA you are ready to
         to see it in action.  The best way to see it in action is to build, deploy, and run
         the
                <b>Car Rental System</b> sample that comes with AndroMDA.
            </p>

            <p class="std">
         Have a look at the
                <a href="../sampleintro.html">Sample Intro</a> to find
         out more about how to build and use the
                <b>Car Rental System</b> sample.  Once you
         have run it you might want to browse around the UML model and generated code to get
         a feel for how was put together.
            </p>

            <p class="std">
                <b>Do It</b>
            </p>

            <p class="std">
         You are now ready to try AndroMDA on a simple project of your own.  We've provided with
         the AndroMDA distribution a blank Poseidon project and an ANT based wizard to help you
         get started with your first AndroMDA based project.
            </p>

            <p class="std">
        Here are the instructions to create your first EJB or Hibernate based project using AndroMDA:

                <ul>
                    <li class="std">
                        <code>cd samples</code> - this directory contains blank project templates
            and a wizard.xml file to help copy and setup these blanks projects.
                    </li>

                    <li class="std">
                        <code>edit wizard.properties</code> - in order for the wizard script to help
            setup a new project for you it needs you to set the values for a few properties.
            For example, the wizard will need to know the path to your AndroMDA installation and your
            JBoss installation. Use only
                        <b>ABSOLUTE PATHS</b> when setting these properties.
                    </li>

                    <li class="std">
            To create an empty EJB based project:
                        <br/>
                        <code>ant -f wizard.xml -Dproject.home=c:/temp/myproject  ejb</code> - run the wizard script,
            using ANT, and use the 'project.home' property to tell it where to place your new project.
                    </li>

                    <li class="std">
            To create an empty Hibernate based project:
                        <br/>
                        <code>ant -f wizard.xml -Dproject.home=c:/temp/myproject  hibernate</code> - run the wizard script,
            using ANT, and use the 'project.home' property to tell it where to place your new project.
                    </li>

                    <li class="std">
                        <code>cd c:/temp/myproject</code> - go to the newly created project directory and have a look
            around at what is there.  In the
                        <code>src/uml</code> directory there is a blank UML model
            that can be opened using Poseidon. If you are using a UML tool other than Poseidon then
            you will have to write a blank-model of your own, but at least you have this little project
            environment to get you started.
                    </li>

                    <li class="std">
                        <code>ant</code> - if you invoke ant in your new project directory it will build the blank
            model and deploy it into your JBoss installation. The UML model that comes with this project
            template is not completely blank, it has one diagram and a couple of model elements just
            to provide a compiling example of EJBs or Hibernate objects.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p class="std">
        You can use this basic project as a starting point for your modeling.  Edit the blank
        UML model and design your own beans.
            </p>

            <p class="std">
         There are a few things that should be noted about this basic project setup:

                <ul>
                    <li class="std">
             Session Bean names have to end in the word 'Service' - such as 'AdminService',
             'InventoryService'.  This is not a requirement of AndroMDA. It has to do with the
                        <code>buid.xml</code> file that comes with this project. If you want to
             understand the reason why then have a look at the build.xml file and look for
             the
                        <b>replace</b> command which is used to process the ejb deployment descriptor file.
                    </li>

                    <li class="std">
             PrimaryKeys - be sure to remember that each entity bean must have at least one
             attribute that is a primary key.  Currently the code generation templates assume
             that the primary key is a String.
                    </li>

                    <li class="std">
             No Struts support in this blank project -  this little project has no Struts
             support built into it.  It is not much extra work to setup the project to start
             generating struts code too.  Take a look at the
                        <b>Car Rental System</b> sample.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Maven</h3>
            <p class="std">
                Make sure you have both Maven and the 
                <a href="maven-andromdapp-plugin/index.html">AndroMDApp Maven Plugin</a>
                installed.
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                Go into a directory in which you want to create your working directory.
                For example, suppose you want to work in C:\development\java\my-project, then
                simply go into C:\development\java\
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                At the console type:
                <source>
                    C:\development\java> maven andromdapp:generate
                </source>
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                Answer the questions you are prompted to answer
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                Giving your project the id 'my-project' will create a subdirectory
                with the same name, so you'll have C:\development\java\my-project.
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                C:\development\java\my-project\mda\src\uml will contain an empty XMI
                document, you can use it to get started modelling your application
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                Simply typing 'maven' in C:\development\java\my-project will build your
                application and it will put all the binaries into your local
                Maven repository (by default, this is the .maven directory in your 
                user home, i.e. $HOME for linux/unix, %USERPROFILE% for windows).
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                Optionally you can go into a subdirectory to build it separately from
                the others, this is much quicker and it will make it easy to focus on
                only a part of your application.
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                If your application 'my-project' has been built succesfully you can find
                the binaries here: %USERPROFILE%\.maven\repository\my-project\
                (for *nix users: $USER_HOME\.maven\repository\my-project\)
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                By default the application will generate an EJB backend (optionally with a
                Hibernate persistence layer) and a Struts front-end.
            </p>

            <h3>Ant</h3>
            <p class="std">
                Download the AndroMDA 3.0 binary distribution from the AndroMDA SourceForge.net
                <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=73047" target="_blank">files</a>
                page.
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                Unzip into any location and go into the 'ant' subdirectory. Type 'ant' there to invoke
                the Ant build process. (You will need to have Ant installed of course)
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                Answer the questions, a little later you will have your environment
                setup for you. It consists of a hierarchy of build.xml files and
                corresponding property files.  In addition, it will create a directory 
				called 'lib' containing all necessary dependencies for your newly generated application.			
            </p>
            <p class="std">
				To successfully build your new application, you must do two things:
                <ol>
					<li>
						Copy the resulting lib directory to the directory of your newly generated application. 
					</li>
					<li>
				        Change to your newly generated application directory and type 'ant' and you'll
                        see your AndroMDA powered Ant application application being built!	
					</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                Please note:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The default UML model is not empty, it contains the Animal-Quiz sample
                        (see the samples), this application is modeled using entity inheritance and
                        only be deployed using Hibernate as persistence layer.
                        It is up to you to model your application instead of this sample, it is simply provided
                        as a convenience.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        An empty UML model will currently result in a build failure, we hope to solve this issue
                        shortly.
