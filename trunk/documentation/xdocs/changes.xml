                        It is now possible to specify labels and values differently
                        for selectable parameters such as in comboboxes and lists.
                        The form containing such a parameter will have two new properties:
                        'valueList' and 'labelList'. If you do not specify the 'labelList'
                        property it will assume the values of the 'valueList'.
                        The backing list has been made readonly
                        because it will construct a special array to be handled by the Struts tags.

                        Controller implementation do not get form types passed in the argument, instead
                        there is an interface aggregating common form properties, this way forms
                        of several different types implementing this interface can be passed in.
                        This elegantly allows a single controller operation to be called from different
                        actions (which each have their own form).

                    <td valign="top" class="std">
                        A major change has been incorporated into the cartridge, you will have to
                        be very careful when migrating to a version after this date.
                        ActionForms are back into the request scope so their properties will not be
                        persisted into the session as was the case before. Bpm4Struts now is
                        intelligent enough to determine which properties should be available in which
                        ActionForm (even in ambiguous cases such as cyclic processes or when
                        multiple actions target multiple pages without a 1-to-1 mapping.
                        The reason for this drastic change was a possible bug in the server-side
                        validation framework. It would happen that forms were not properly recognized on
                        the server while the client could parse them fine.
                        In order to properly migrate you should at least need to fix the controller
                        implementations (you will have compilation errors otherwise), unfortunately
                        you will need to update all JSP pages. The changes are minimal so you might
                        consider looking at the differences manually (we are back at using the Struts HTML
                        tag library instead of the plain old HTML tags directly).

                        <code>modelValidation</code> flag has been added that allows us
                        to turn on/off model validation during processing.   By default
                        model validation occurs, however its sometimes nice to turn it
                        off for performance reasons (i.e. you have a really big model).

                        are abstract classes now, so make sure you use 'extends'
                        instead of 'implements' when using the cartridge after
                        this date.

                        It will be improved in the future.
                        The reason we have these JS tooltips is that now it can also
                        support images and text of arbitrary length.

                        will occur.
                        This change was needed in order to allow action parameters to
                        have the same names in a single use-case. Without this feature
                        the form would contain the same field name more than once, and that
                        is not allowed in Java.
