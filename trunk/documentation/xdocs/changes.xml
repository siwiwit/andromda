                    <td valign="top" class="std">
                        This update is the last one that will impact the way users model their Struts application.
                        A change was needed due to a missing feature: "multibox". In order to properly fix it
                        some other changes were required too.
                        <ol>
                            <li>You can now put any widget in a table, you can do that by simply linking an action
                                parameter using the <code>@andromda.struts.view.field.tablelink</code>
                                tagged value to an incoming table collection. You must of course link to an existing
                                table column.
                            </li>
                            <li>Previously performing this step would simply create a hyperlink, now you would need to
                                set the action parameter's <code>@andromda.struts.view.field.type</code>
                                tagged value to 'link' in order to achieve that.
                            </li>
                            <li>Due to HTML limitations you can only make links to the same table from a single
                                action. The reason is that there can be only one form around the table. If you still
                                want to have multiple actions working on the same table you will need to patch in
                                manually using JavaScript (setting the target action URL).
                            </li>
                            <li>If you want to use the
                                <a href="http://struts.apache.org/userGuide/struts-html.html#multibox">multibox</a>
                                feature you need first to model a collection or
                                array page-variable that contains the values against which to match. Next you create
                                a table link, thereby selecting the table column. Finally you set the field type of the
                                action parameter to something like this (assuming the multibox collection is
                                called 'myValues')
                                <code>@andromda.struts.view.field.type = multibox:myValues</code>
                            </li>
                            <li>The online store has been extended with an example of this, just open the model
                                and check out the 'buy this item' action. The 'test' and 'available' parameters
                                are rendered as widgets in the table, the 'available' column is a multibox.
                                Please also note how the multibox collection (called 'availableItems') is preloaded
                                by the 'loadItems' controller operations.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p class="highlight">
                            I strongly recommend not relying too much on the widgets-in-table feature
                            yet, it is experimental and is likely to change in the future. The reason it has
                            been put in is to see whether or not it is usable. A restriction currently
                            is that you will not have any way to submit the changes you make in the table,
                            for that to work we would need to apply some updates to the rendered rows so a submit button
                            could properly trigger the sending of the form.

                        AndroMDA now automatically assigns a suitable name to association ends with a
			            'many' cardinality and an empty name. Before only the name of the target classifier
			            was taken into account, now it is analyzed and a proper (English) name is constructed
			            (word:words, key:keys, property:properties).
			            If your code relies on such unlabeled association ends it might be possible that an
			            AndroMDA run on your UMl model will result in code that is uncompilable in combination
			            with your existing implementation classes, a simple rename will be sufficient.

                        methods now have their names properly rendered according to the Java Bean specification
                        (getXXX becomes isXXX).

                        The latest major bpm4struts update did not prove to be a very elegant solution,
                        this led us to revise
                        the implementation and come up with an alternative one. Here's a list of what has changed:
                        <ol>
                            <li>parameters with the same name and in the same use-case are required to also
                                be of the same type</li>
                            <li>form fields do no longer have their name prefixed with the name of the action</li>
                            <li>forms now implement an interface for each controller operation they defer to</li>
                            <li>it is now needed to put arguments in the controller operations, these arguments
                                will be available in the form interface that is accessible programmatically</li>
                            <li>these arguments will need to have the
                                <code>
                                @andromda.struts.view.field.type</code> tagged value set to 'select' in case
                                you want to prepopulate a list of entries (see samples)
                            </li>
                            <li>currently it is also needed to specify the table columns (just as you
                                would on a collection-type page variable) in case the argument
                                maps onto an action parameter which is displayed in tabular format, but this
                                will be solved soon</li>
                        </ol>

                            <li>We no longer have the controller operation interfaces the forms were implementing</li>
                            <li>Instead we have a controller operation for each different action that defers to them,
                                this means you sometimes have the same operation more than once with only a different
                                argument type for the form. This seems to be the most optimal and realistic
                                implementation, forms cannot be shared using interfaces aggregating the fields
                                because field names carry the action name as a prefix and this cannot be changed
                                because in that case validation rules would be impossible to determine for fields
                                that have the same name and type over different page actions.

                        the 'Impl' suffix. This has been done for consistency with other cartridges
                        and because it is cleaner not to have any suffix on the interface or
                        abstract parents.

                        The form containing such a parameter will have two new properties:
                        'valueList' and 'labelList'. If you do not specify the 'labelList'
                        property it will assume the values of the 'valueList'.
                        The backing list has been made readonly
                        because it will construct a special array to be handled by the Struts tags.

                        there is an interface aggregating common form properties, this way forms
                        of several different types implementing this interface can be passed in.
                        This elegantly allows a single controller operation to be called from different
                        actions (which each have their own form).

                        A major change has been incorporated into the cartridge, you will have to
                        be very careful when migrating to a version after this date.
                        ActionForms are back into the request scope so their properties will not be
                        persisted into the session as was the case before. Bpm4Struts now is
                        intelligent enough to determine which properties should be available in which
                        ActionForm (even in ambiguous cases such as cyclic processes or when
                        multiple actions target multiple pages without a 1-to-1 mapping.
                        The reason for this drastic change was a possible bug in the server-side
                        validation framework. It would happen that forms were not properly recognized on
                        the server while the client could parse them fine.
                        In order to properly migrate you should at least need to fix the controller
                        implementations (you will have compilation errors otherwise), unfortunately
                        you will need to update all JSP pages. The changes are minimal so you might
                        consider looking at the differences manually (we are back at using the Struts HTML
                        tag library instead of the plain old HTML tags directly).
