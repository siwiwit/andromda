            <p>
                This page provides directions to create the PeopleService using MagicDraw. The model is
                shown below for your reference.
            </p>

            <p>
                <div align="center">
                    <img src="../../../images/magicdraw/PeopleService.jpg"/>
                </div>
            </p>

            <p>
              <ol>
                <li>In the TimeTracker model create a package called <code>service</code> under
                    <code>org.andromda.timetracker</code>. We will create our services in this package.</li>
                <li>In the Containment Tree on the left, right-click on the <code>service</code> package and select
                    New Diagram > Class Diagram. Type in Services as the name of this diagram
                    and click OK. The diagram is created and opened in a new window.</li>
                <li>Add a new class to the diagram and name it <code>PeopleService</code>.</li>
                <li>Add the stereotype called Service to <code>PeopleService</code>.</li>
                <li>Add three methods to <code>PeopleService</code> as shown above. Be careful with the return type
                    of the last method. It is not interpretted as a <code>PersonVO[]</code> type when entered
                    through the diagram. Double-click on the method and choose the correct return type in the
                    operation specification dialog box.</li>
                <li>From the Containment Tree on the left, drag the <code>Person</code> class on to the diagram.</li>
                <li>Create a dependency from <code>PeopleService</code> to <code>Person</code>.</li>
                <li>Make sure your class diagram matches the one shown above.</li>
                <li>Save the model by selecting File > Save Project.</li>
              </ol>
            </p>

            <p>
              We are now ready to generate code for the <code>PeopleService</code>. Please go back to the main
              tutorial page and continue from where you left off.
