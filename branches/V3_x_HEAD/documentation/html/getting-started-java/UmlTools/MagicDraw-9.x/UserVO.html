    <h2>Create UserVO</h2>
    <!------------------------- Intro Text ------------------------->
    <p>
        This page provides directions to create the <code>UserVO</code> using MagicDraw.
        The model is shown below for your reference.
    </p>
    <!------------------------- Main Text ------------------------->
    <table width="100%" border="0">
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <!-- img src="Images/UserVO.jpg" alt="UserVO" / -->
                <td align="center" style="width: 100%">

    <p>
        We will create <code>UserVO</code> and <code>UserVO[]</code> in a package named
        <code>org.andromda.timetracker.vo</code>. When finished, the containment tree in
        MagicDraw will look like the screen shot on the right.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Start MagicDraw.</li>
        <li>Select File > Open Project... and traverse to C:/timetracker/mda/src/main/uml/timetracker.xmi.
            Click Open to open this model.</li>
        <li>The TimeTracker model will now open showing the only class diagram present in this
            model. The title of this diagram is "DataTypes[datatype]". This diagram contains
            platform independent datatypes that should be used in your UML model.</li>
        <li>In the Containment Tree on the left, right-click on the root element called Data
            and select New Element > Model. A new model will be created under the root element
            with an edit box to its side. Type in TimeTracker as the name of this model. MagicDraw
            has the concept of a hierarchy of models. Each model in the hierarchy can be broken
            out and stored as a separate file. This allows multiple developers to work on different
            parts of a master model.</li>
        <li>Now right-click on the TimeTracker model you just created and select New Element
            > Package. A new package will be created under the TimeTracker model element with
            an edit box to its side. Type in <code>org.andromda.timetracker</code> as the name
            of the package. AndroMDA will map this package to a Java package with the same name.
            Note: Make sure the package name is exactly <code>org.andromda.timetracker</code>,
            with no leading or trailing spaces. We have found that some browsers introduce a
            leading space in the package name if you copy it from this page!</li>
        <li>Now create a package called <code>vo</code> under <code>org.andromda.timetracker</code>.
            We will create our value objects in this package. Note that AndroMDA does not require
            this package structure. We are doing it simply to separate our value objects from
            other type of objects such as business entities, services etc.</li>
        <li>In the Containment Tree on the left, right-click on the <code>vo</code> package
            and select New Diagram > Class Diagram. A Class Diagram Specification dialog appears.
            Type in Value Objects as the name of this diagram and click OK. The diagram is created
            and opened in a new window.</li>
        <li>In the toolbar on the left of the class diagram click on the Class tool {mosimage}.
            <!-- img src="Images/MagicDrawClassTool.jpg" alt="Class Tool" / -->
            Now click anywhere inside the diagram. A new class will be created. The class will
            be automatically selected as indicated by the 4 knobs around it. (If you somehow
            deselected the class, then select it again by clicking on it.) Now type the word
            "UserVO". This word will be entered as the name of the class.</li>
        <li>Let's add some documentation for the <code>UserVO</code> class. It is always a good
            idea to document your model. Documentation added to model elements such as classes,
            attributes and methods is carried over to the code as comments. Double-click on
            the <code>UserVO</code> class to bring up the Class Specification dialog. Add the
            following sentence in the Documentation field and click OK: "This class represents
            a value object that carries information about a TimeTracker user."</li>
        <li>Now add the stereotype <code>ValueObject</code> to class <code>UserVO</code>. To
            do this, right-click on the class and select Stereotype. In the next level menu,
            check ValueObject and click Apply. The <code>UserVO</code> class will now have the
            <code>ValueObject</code> stereotype.</li>
        <li>Let's add <code>id</code> as an attribute of <code>UserVO</code>. Right-click on
            the <code>UserVO</code> class and select Insert New Attribute. A new attribute is
            inserted with the specification "-unnamed1". Write over this specification with
            this new one: "+id : Long" (be sure to delete the minus sign in front of the name).
            Do not press Enter after typing this attribute (that will create another attribute).
            Instead click outside the class to finish entering the attribute. Note that attributes
            are always generated as private members of a class. However the visibilities of
            the associated getter and setter are determined by the visibility of the attribute
            specification. In this case we have specified public visibility (by using the plus
            sign) and hence the getter and setter for the <code>id</code> attribute will be
            public.</li>
        <li>Now add three more public attributes called <code>username</code>, <code>firstName</code>
            and <code>lastName</code> to the <code>UserVO</code> class. Make them <code>String</code>
            type.</li>
        <li>Add a new class to the diagram and name it <code>UserVO[]</code>.</li>
        <li>Make sure your class diagram matches the one shown above exactly. (It is okay if
            your class shows an empty operation compartment. This can be hidden very easily).</li>
        <li>Make sure that the MagicDraw containment tree matches the screen shot shown above.</li>
        <li>Save your <code>TimeTracker</code> model by selecting File > Save Project.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Congratulations! You have now specified the <code>UserVO</code> value object of
        the <code>TimeTracker</code> application. We are now ready to generate some code.
        Please go back to the main tutorial page and continue from where you left off.
