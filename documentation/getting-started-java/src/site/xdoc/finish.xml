                We have now covered the key concepts needed to use AndroMDA. You may wish to complete
                the remaining screens as an exercise, or move on to the killer app that you always
                wanted to write! Having mastered AndroMDA, you now have a powerful tool to take
                on the most challenging applications ahead of you. Not only will you complete them
                successfully, but you will also complete them with greater speed and quality.

                Be sure to look at other out-of-the-box cartridges available to you - check

                for a list. As mentioned earlier, if you don't find
                a cartridge you really need, you can always roll your own - look at the

                Of course, if you think your cartridge will be useful to others, we hope you will contribute it to the community.
                We have created an open source project called
