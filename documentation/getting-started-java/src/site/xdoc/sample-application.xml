                Northwind Corporation uses a paper based system to track the time of their employees.
                This process is highly inefficient and hence the CIO of Northwind has tasked you
                to create an online time tracking system called TimeTracker. Unfortunately, he wants
                the system delivered by next week or he will give away the job to someone else.
                Suddenly, you remember your conversation with a friend who was raving about how
                AndroMDA can generate large portions of an application from business level specifications.
                You say to yourself, &quot;If this is really true, it will help me meet my deadline.
                Let's give AndroMDA a try.&quot; So you accept the CIO's offer and get to work.

                Your first stop is at the office of the Director of Human Resources. You ask her
                to describe the current time tracking process and she replies, &quot;At the beginning
                of every week, each person picks up a new timecard from the supply room. As they
                work on different tasks, employees record their start and stop times on this timecard.
                Every task has a task id which they look up from the employee handbook. At the end
                of the week, people submit their timecards to their managers for approval. If rejected,
                the manager must put a comment on the timecard stating the reason for rejection.
                The submitter of the timecard must then make necessary corrections and resubmit
                the timecard for approval.&quot; You politely ask the director for a copy of a typical
                timecard. Here's what she gives you:

            </div>
            <p>
                Armed with this knowledge, you are eager to get started. You rush back to your office
                and whip up a quick
                <a href="timetracker-prototype.zip">HTML prototype</a>
                (yes, download it and take a look). You run the prototype by
                the Northwind CIO and he loves it! It's now time to build the real thing. Click <a href="env-setup.html">here</a>
                for instructions to install the necessary development tools and software.
