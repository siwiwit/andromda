    <section name="What is AndroMDA?">

      <p>
          In short, AndroMDA is an open source <a href="http://www.klasse.nl/english/mda/mda-faq.html">MDA</a> 
          framework - it takes any number of models 
          (usually UML models stored in XMI produced from case-tools) combined with any 
          number of andromda plugins (cartridge and translation-libraries) and produces
          any number of custom components.

      <p>
        <b>Why would you want to use it?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
          You would want to use AndroMDA for a number of reasons:
          <ol>
            <li>
                It elimates the need to write redundant code.   
            </li>
            <li>
                Your project models <strong>WILL</strong> reflect your code.
            </li>
            <li>
                Projects are documented/diagrammed in a standard platform independant way 
                making it much easier/faster to adapt to ever rapidly changing technologies.
            </li>
            <li>
                You'll have artifacts (your models) that allow much easier communication 
                with the business side of things.
            </li>
          </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>How does AndroMDA work?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        AndroMDA reads models into memory making these object models available to its
        plugins.  These plugins define exactly what AndroMDA will and will 
        NOT generate.  Each plugin is completely customizable to a specific project's needs.
