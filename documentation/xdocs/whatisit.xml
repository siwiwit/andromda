        <section name="What is AndroMDA?">

            <p>
          In short, AndroMDA is an open source
                <a href="http://www.klasse.nl/english/mda/mda-faq.html">MDA</a>
          framework - it takes any number of models 
          (usually UML models stored in XMI produced from case-tools) combined with any 
          number of andromda plugins (cartridge and translation-libraries) and produces
          any number of custom components.  You can generate components for any language you want,
          Java, .Net, HTML, PHP, anything really, you just write (or customize existing) plugins 
          to support it and you're good to go.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Why would you want to use it?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
          You would want to use AndroMDA for a number of reasons:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                It elimates the need to write redundant code.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                Your project models
                        <strong>WILL</strong> reflect your code.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                Projects are documented/diagrammed in a standard platform independant way 
                making it much easier/faster to adapt to ever rapidly changing technologies.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                You'll have artifacts (your models) that allow much easier communication 
                with the business side of things.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>How does AndroMDA work?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                AndroMDA reads models into memory making these object models available to its
                plugins.  These plugins define exactly what AndroMDA will and will 
                NOT generate.  Each plugin is completely customizable to a project's specific needs.
            </p>
