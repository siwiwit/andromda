            <question>
                My company likes our DBA to design our database schemas,
                is there any way that I can generate a model from an
                existing schema?
            </question>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    Yes there's a AndroMDA utility called
                    <a href="andromda-schema2xmi/index.html">Schema2XMI</a>
                    that will do exactly that.

            <question>
                Will moving to AndroMDA 3.X mean I need to switch from Ant
                to Maven?
            </question>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    While Maven is the build/project tool utilized by
                    AndroMDA, you can still just as easily use an AndroMDA
                    project with Ant.  In fact we have an Ant tool that will
                    generate an Ant AndroMDA project structure for you. Please
                    see the
                    <a href="starting.html#starting-with-ant">Ant</a>
                    section of the getting started page for more details.

            <question>
                What JDK can I use with AndroMDA?  Can I use JDK 1.3?
            </question>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    AndroMDA will only run correctly with JDK 1.4 or above.

            <question>
                I haven't used this product in the past, but I'm curious: will it stay in sync with code modifications?
                Let's say I do a model in Rose, bring it into AndroMDA, and generate code from it. Then I modify the
                generated code by hand. Will the UML model be updated automatically ?
            </question>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    Changes in the code will not be reflected back into the UML model, so the answer is no.
                    The generation is unidirectional from UML to &lt;code&gt;.

        <faq id="regeneration">
            <question>
                Will my custom code be overwritten the next time I (re)generate ?
            </question>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    Incremental development and regeneration cycles are supported by AndroMDA
                </p>
                <p>
                    For classes this is not a problem, abstract parent classes are regenerated, the child
                    classes are only generated when they do not yet exist, so you will put your custom code in
                    there and you are sure it will stay there, worst case you'll have compilation
                    errors when building your project
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jsps, properties files, etc... are a different story because the notion of extending one another
                    does not exist. Tackling this problem is not so easy as with classes. Anyway, it is partially
                    supported. For the Bpm4Struts cartridge JSPs will be using Tiles to separate as much as possible
                    those parts that need update and those that don't need update. The cartridge also generates CSS
                    stylesheets, i18n properties files, etc.. subsequently making it easier to identify which files
                    would need manual update
                </p>
                <p>
                    what most users will do anyway is fine-tune the templates to their needs, they are quite easy to
                    read and are written in Velocity (any other template-engine can easily be supported), and in
                    doing so the generated files will be customized to your very needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The purpose of AndroMDA is not to generate your complete application with the click of a button,
                    maybe that will be possible in the future :-) but not yet for now. If you are tired of writing the same
                    code all the time, updating XDoclet tags, etc... and you want to keep focus on
                    the business, AndroMDA is for you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For users not familiar with AndroMDA, here's an approximation of the percentage of code generated:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Persistence (EJB/Hibernate): 100%</li>
                        <li>Business (EJB): 30%</li>
                        <li>WebServices (Axis): 100%</li>
                        <li>Presentation (Struts): 80%</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The presentation layer is taken care of.
                    The business layer needs an implementation since this is (or at least should be) unique for each
                    different application.
                    The presentation will also run out-of-the-box but you'll still need to wire it to the business
                    layer. The web application can be deployed and run without it though, be it with a 'dummy'
                    implementation behind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since each layer is cleanly separated each one of them can be developed and tested independently
                    before linking them together.

        <faq id="speed">
            <question>
                I have a large model and it takes a while for AndroMDA to process everything,
                is there anyway to speed things (i.e. selecting only certain cartridges to 
                run against my model)?
            </question>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    Yes, you can <em>filter</em> the cartridges you want to run against your model by
                    using the 
                    <a href="maven-andromda-plugin/properties.html#maven.andromda.cartridgeFilter">maven.andromda.cartridgeFilter</a> 
                    property (when using the <a href="maven-andromda-plugin/index.html">AndroMDA Maven Plugin</a>) 
                    or the <a href="anttask.html#cartridgeFilter">cartridgeFilter</a> attribute (when 
                    using the <a href="anttask.html">AndroMDA Ant task</a>).

        <faq id="magicdraw-uml-standard-profile">
            <question>
                I tried using MagicDraw with Andromda v2.1.2 by trying with the model-report cartridge that comes
                with andromda.
                I am unable to get passed opening the file in the ant task, I am getting an error.
                This happens in both in XMI1.1 and 1.2 format which Magicdraw 7.5 support. What can I do to solve
                this problem ?
            </question>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    Your model contains a reference to a module called "UML Standard Profile".
                    AndroMDA 2.1.2 is not able to resolve such a reference.
                    AndroMDA 3.0 contains code to resolve such references.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You have three options:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Make the profile part of your model.</li>
                        <li>Remove the profile entirely from your model.</li>
                        <li>Use AndroMDA 3.0.</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Option 1 will make your model larger. Option 2 will make it smaller but you will lose
                    all standard UML stereotypes, datatypes and tagged value definitions.
                    Option 3 makes your life a little less certain although the new software already works quite well. :-)
