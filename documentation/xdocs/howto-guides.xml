            <p>
                A few guides have been written to make it easier to get started using AndroMDA
                on your projects, on this page you will find the links to those guides.

                        <strong>A step-by-step user guide for people new to AndroMDA</strong><br/>
                        This user guide is a user contribution and aims at an audience which is familiar with Java
                        (and preferably J2EE), but new to AndroMDA or MDA in general.

                        <strong>This getting started guide is *highly* recommended newbie material.</strong><br/>
                        Explains how to set up a new project template in which you use AndroMDA to generate
                        code from your UML model. The project templates have been specifically designed
                        for J2EE applications.

                        <strong>This howto will teach you how to model your presentation layer.</strong><br/>
                        Bpm4Struts is a cartridge that is able to generate Struts code from activity
                        graphs and use-cases. This guide briefly explains the way you should approach
                        and eventually model your application's architecture.

                        <strong>This howto will teach you how to model your persistence and application layer,
                            also recommended for people using the EJB and/or Hibernate cartridges.
                        </strong><br/>
                        The Spring cartridge is used to generate your application's back end, it generates Spring
                        services (optionally wrapped by Session EJBs) using Hibernate POJOs for persistence.

                        Explains what is needed to generate CRUD pages, services and DAOs. This feature generates
                        an administration console for your entities that works out-of-the-box, and that will perfectly 
                        integrate with the existing application.

                        In this short howto you'll learn what the AndroMDA server can do for you and how to configure
                        and start it.
