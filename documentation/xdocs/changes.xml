                The bpm4struts generated <code>web.xml</code> file now contains some merge points, similar to

                you can completely ignore them because they are commented out. But for some people it might be useful

                to use the aggregation kind of an association end (composite is not lazy, the other kinds are lazy)

                Added new tagged value to BPM4Struts called <code>@andromda.struts.view.field.reset</code>
                which allows one to specify specific fields that should be reset on a transition.  This
                is useful when you want certain fields to be reset after action execution but you don't
                want the entire form to be reset.

                BPM4Struts can now extract resource message keys from exceptions thrown from the business
                tier.  For example, if an operation in your service throws an exception with
                the message " {some.message.key} an exception occurred!", BPM4Struts will
                extract the <em>some.message.key</em> from the exception, and add it to the
                request as a struts action error.  You then place this new key in your custom
                message resources with a corresponding message, and next time the error occurs
                this new message will be displayed (instead of the exception).
                The exception handling pattern and a few other related properties are configurable, 
                you can learn more about them on <a href="andromda-bpm4struts-cartridge/namespace.html">BPM4Struts Namespace Properties</a>.
                <strong>NOTE:</strong> if the pattern can not be found in an exception processing
                continues as normal and the exception will be displayed.

                This update is the last one that will impact the way users model their Struts application.
                A change was needed due to a missing feature: "multibox". In order to properly fix it
                some other changes were required too.
                <ol>
                    <li>You can now put any widget in a table, you can do that by simply linking an action
                        parameter using the <code>@andromda.struts.view.field.tablelink</code>
                        tagged value to an incoming table collection. You must of course link to an existing
                        table column.
                    </li>
                    <li>Previously performing this step would simply create a hyperlink, now you would need to
                        set the action parameter's <code>@andromda.struts.view.field.type</code>
                        tagged value to 'link' in order to achieve that.
                    </li>
                    <li>Due to HTML limitations you can only make links to the same table from a single
                        action. The reason is that there can be only one form around the table. If you still
                        want to have multiple actions working on the same table you will need to patch in
                        manually using JavaScript (setting the target action URL).
                    </li>
                    <li>If you want to use the
                        <a href="http://struts.apache.org/userGuide/struts-html.html#multibox">multibox</a>
                        feature you need first to model a collection or
                        array page-variable that contains the values against which to match. Next you create
                        a table link, thereby selecting the table column. Finally you set the field type of the
                        action parameter to something like this (assuming the multibox collection is
                        called 'myValues')
                        <code>@andromda.struts.view.field.type = multibox:myValues</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>The online store has been extended with an example of this, just open the model
                        and check out the 'buy this item' action. The 'test' and 'available' parameters
                        are rendered as widgets in the table, the 'available' column is a multibox.
                        Please also note how the multibox collection (called 'availableItems') is preloaded
                        by the 'loadItems' controller operations.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p class="highlight">
                    I strongly recommend not relying too much on the widgets-in-table feature
                    yet, it is experimental and is likely to change in the future. The reason it has
                    been put in is to see whether or not it is usable. A restriction currently
                    is that you will not have any way to submit the changes you make in the table,
                    for that to work we would need to apply some updates to the rendered rows so a submit button
                    could properly trigger the sending of the form.

                AndroMDA now automatically assigns a suitable name to association ends with a
                'many' cardinality and an empty name. Before only the name of the target classifier
                was taken into account, now it is analyzed and a proper (English) name is constructed
                (word:words, key:keys, property:properties).
                If your code relies on such unlabeled association ends it might be possible that an

                The latest major bpm4struts update did not prove to be a very elegant solution,
                this led us to revise
                the implementation and come up with an alternative one. Here's a list of what has changed:
                <ol>
                    <li>parameters with the same name and in the same use-case are required to also
                        be of the same type</li>

                    <li>forms now implement an interface for each controller operation they defer to</li>
                    <li>it is now needed to put arguments in the controller operations, these arguments
                        will be available in the form interface that is accessible programmatically</li>
                    <li>these arguments will need to have the
                        <code>
                        @andromda.struts.view.field.type</code> tagged value set to 'select' in case
                        you want to prepopulate a list of entries (see samples)
                    </li>
                    <li>currently it is also needed to specify the table columns (just as you
                        would on a collection-type page variable) in case the argument
                        maps onto an action parameter which is displayed in tabular format, but this
                        will be solved soon</li>

                This change fixes some issues with the most recent updates for bpm4struts:

                    <li>We no longer have the controller operation interfaces the forms were implementing</li>
                    <li>Instead we have a controller operation for each different action that defers to them,
                        this means you sometimes have the same operation more than once with only a different
                        argument type for the form. This seems to be the most optimal and realistic
                        implementation, forms cannot be shared using interfaces aggregating the fields
                        because field names carry the action name as a prefix and this cannot be changed
                        because in that case validation rules would be impossible to determine for fields

                A major change has been incorporated into the cartridge, you will have to
                be very careful when migrating to a version after this date.
                ActionForms are back into the request scope so their properties will not be
                persisted into the session as was the case before. Bpm4Struts now is
                intelligent enough to determine which properties should be available in which
                ActionForm (even in ambiguous cases such as cyclic processes or when
                multiple actions target multiple pages without a 1-to-1 mapping.
                The reason for this drastic change was a possible bug in the server-side
                validation framework. It would happen that forms were not properly recognized on
                the server while the client could parse them fine.
                In order to properly migrate you should at least need to fix the controller
                implementations (you will have compilation errors otherwise), unfortunately
                you will need to update all JSP pages. The changes are minimal so you might
                consider looking at the differences manually (we are back at using the Struts HTML
                tag library instead of the plain old HTML tags directly).
