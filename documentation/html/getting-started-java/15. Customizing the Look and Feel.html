    <h2>Customizing the Look and Feel</h2>
    <!------------------------- Intro Text ------------------------->
    <p>
        In this section we will customize the look and feel of the search screen as specified
        in the TimeTracker prototype.
    </p>
    <!------------------------- Main Text ------------------------->
    <p>
        The basic process for front-end customization is pretty simple. As you know, AndroMDA
        generates front-end elements (such as JSPs, style sheets and javascript) in the
        web\target\src directory. If you need to customize any of these elements, just copy
        them over to the web\src\main directory, maintaining the same tree structure. Now
        you can make any edits to these files. When you build your application again, maven
        will copy the artifacts from the src directory to the target directory, overwriting
        the automatically generated files. It will then proceed to build the <code>war</code>
        from the target directory. Thus you can have a mix for auto-generated and customized
        files in your <code>war</code>. Note that it is best to wait until a screen is functionally
        complete before starting to customize the look and feel - making functional changes
        after customization makes it difficult to syncronize the artifacts.
    </p>
    <p>
        With this background, we are ready to customize our front-end. Note that customizations
        requires detailed knowledge of HTML, CSS, JSP, Struts, Tiles, JavaScript and related
        front-end technologies. We cannot possibly cover all these topics in this tutorial,
        so we will simply provide the customized files to you. Follow the steps below to
        customize the search screen and run the application:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Download <a id="fm_file" href="/images/stories/tutorial_java/custom-look-and-feel.zip">
            custom-look-and-feel.zip</a> and unzip it at <code>C:\timetracker\web\src\main</code>.
            You will get a sub-directory under <code>main</code> called <code>jsp</code>. This
            directory further contains 3 sub-directories:
            <ul>
                <li><code>layout</code>: a new Tiles layouts and related files</li>
                <li><code>org</code>: customized JSP for the search screen</li>
                <li><code>styles</code>: a new style sheet used by our custom JSP</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Edit the file <code>C:\timetracker\web\src\main\properties\messages.properties</code>
            and completely overwrite its content with the properties shown below. These properties
            hold messages used by our JSPs.
            <pre>
#Temporary message until Approve Timecards page is defined
approve.timecards.title=Approve Timecards

# Overrides of AndroMDA generated messages
time.tracker.home=Home

# Custom messages
search.criteria=Search Criteria
search.results=Search Results
            </pre>
        </li>
        <li>Execute the commands <code>mvn clean</code> followed by <code>mvn install</code>
            in the Command Prompt.</li>
        <li>Make sure the JBoss server is running.</li>
        <li>Deploy the application:<br />
            <code>mvn -f app/pom.xml -Ddeploy</code></li>
        <li>Open a browser and make it point to http://localhost:8080/timetracker. The TimeTracker
            search page should appear with the new look and feel.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Congratulations! We are done with the search screen.
