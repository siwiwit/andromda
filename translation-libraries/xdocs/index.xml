  		<section name="What's a Translation-Library?">
  			<p>
  				Translation libraries are used to translate <a href="http://www.klasse.nl/ocl/index.html">OCL</a> 
  				expressions into other languages.  For example, a translation-library could be used to 
  				translate an OCL body expression into a Hibernate-QL query, or EJB-QL query like you see 
  				below.   
  		    </p>
  		    <table>
  		    	<tr>
  		    		<th>
  		    		   This OCL query
  		    		</th>
  		    	</tr>
  		    	<tr>
  		    		<td>
						context org::andromda::contracts::Project::findByProjectTypeStatusAfterWentCurrentDate(
							type:String,
							status:String, 
							wentCurrentDate:Date):Collection (Project) body findByProjectType : 
							allInstances() -> select ( 
								project | 
							        project.type = type 
							and project.status = status
							and project.wentCurrentDate >= wentCurrentDate )	    			
  		    		</td>
  		        </tr>
  		        <tr>
                   <th>
                     	could be translated to: Hibernate-QL
                   </th>		         	
  		        </tr>
  		        <tr>
  		            <td>
					    from org.andromda.contracts.Project as project
					    where project.type = ? 
					    and project.status = ?
					    and project.wentCurrentDate >= ? 			
  		            </td>
  		        </tr>
  		        <tr>
  		        	<th>
  		        		or: EJB-QL
  		        	</th>
  		        </tr>
				<tr>
  		    		<td>
			            SELECT DISTINCT OBJECT(project) 
			            FROM Project project
				        WHERE project.type = ?1 
				        AND project.status = ?2 
				        AND project.wentCurrentDate >= ?3  		    			
  		    		</td>
  		    	</tr>
  		    </table>
  		    <p>
                If you take a look at the 
  			    <a href="../andromda-query-library/index.html">Query Translation-Library</a>, 
  			    you'll see it does just what I describe above.
  		    </p>
  		    <p>
  				In addition to translating OCL query bodies, you could also translate
  				things like constraints (i.e. OCL -> Java, OCL -> SQL, etc).  OCL was orginally designed as a way of describing constraints
  				in your model that weren't possible to express with UML drawings alone.  
  				OCL 2.0 has expanded on the constraint abilities (i.e. <strong>pre</strong>,
  				<strong>post</strong>, <strong>inv</strong>) of OCL and have made 
  				OCL a fully fledged object expression language (which means it probably should
  				be renamed to something like Object Expession Language).

  		<section name="How are Translation-Libraries Used?">
  			<p>
  				Translation libraries are another type of <strong>plugin</strong>
  				used and discovered by the AndroMDA framework.  This means that
  				just like <a href="../andromda-cartridges/index.html">Cartridges</a>
  				they will be found and made available to the framework by placing
  				them on your project's classpath.
