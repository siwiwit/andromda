        <section name="10 steps to write a cartridge">
            <p>This article shows you how to write an AndroMDA cartridge in 10 distinct steps,
                using a sample cartridge which generates an Ant-like build script from a UML deployment model.
                This is why the tutorial cartridge is called "andromda-deployment".

        <section name="The main process for analysis, design and implementation of cartridges ">
            <p>The basic process for cartridge development consists of the following steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Analyze target technology</li>
                <li>Identify, design and generate PSM metaclasses</li>
                <li>Identify transformation rules</li>
                <li>Model, generate and write metafacades</li>
                <li>Write templates</li>
                <li>Write deployment descriptors</li>
                <li>Create UML profile as a modeling guide for your users</li>
                <li>Design cartridge test model using the profile</li>
                <li>Test cartridge</li>
                <li>Deploy cartridge</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                There are also some supporting activities that you need to do in order to get your cartridge and make others use it:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Create empty cartridge and initialize build environment</li>
                <li>Think about versioning and releasing your cartridge in sync with the project teams who use it</li>
            </ol>
            <p>We will now go one step after the other so that you can see how everything works.</p>
