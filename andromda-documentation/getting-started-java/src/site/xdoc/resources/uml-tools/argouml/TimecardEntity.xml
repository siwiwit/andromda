            <p>
                This page provides directions to create the
                <tt>Timecard</tt>
                entity using ArgoUML.
                The model is shown below for your reference.
            </p>

            <div align="center">
                <img src="images/Timecard.png" alt="Timecard"/>
            </div>
            <p>
                Follow the steps below to create the
                <tt>Timecard</tt>
                entity along with the
                two associations.
            </p>
            <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
                <li>Select the diagram called &quot;Domain Objects&quot; and create a class called
                    <tt>Timecard</tt>
                    in it. Make sure the class is created in the
                    <tt>org.andromda.timetracker.domain</tt>
                    package by inspecting the tree in the explorer pane.
                </li>
                <li>Set the stereotype of the
                    <tt>Timecard</tt>
                    class to Entity.
                </li>
                <li>Add the 3 attributes as shown above.</li>
                <li>Add the
                    <tt>findByCriteria()</tt>
                    operation as shown above. By default the operation
                    is created with instance scope. Click &quot;static&quot; in the Modifiers section of the
                    property panel to change it to instance scope. You can confirm the change by
                    checking that the operation name is now underlined on the diagram.
                </li>
                <li>Select the association tool
                    <img src="images/ToolUniAssociation.png" alt="Uni Association Tool"/>
                    from the toolbar. Create an association from
                    <tt>Timecard</tt>
                    to <tt>User</tt>.
                </li>
                <li>Double-click on the 2nd association end in the Connections field and confirm
                    that is the correct end by checking that the type is <tt>User</tt>. Give it
                    the name <tt>submitter</tt>. Set the multiplicity to 1.
                </li>
                <li>Click Other End tool
                    <img src="images/ToolOtherEnd.png" alt="Other Association End Tool"/>
                    to select the other end of the association. Give this end a multiplicity of
                    0..1. It doesn't need a name because it's not navigable and won't be used by code.
                </li>
                <li>Similarly add an association from
                    <tt>Timecard</tt>
                    to <tt>User</tt>.
                    Give the first (from) end a multiplicity of 0..* and the second (to) end
                    the name
                    <tt>approver</tt>
                    and a multiplicity of 0..1. Move the associations
                    up or down as appropriate so they and their labels do not overlap each other.
                </li>
                <li>Save the model by selecting FileSave Project.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Now go back to the main tutorial page and continue from where you left off.
