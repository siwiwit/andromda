                    to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new

                A brief AndroMDA tutorial is featured on IBM's developerworks website, just follow this
                <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/library/wi-arch19/">link</a>.
                (also see our <a href="resources.html">resources</a> and

                Did you ever think: "mmm... all this J2EE stuff is too complex! There must
                be an easier way to program?" Read the good news: AndroMDA is here to help!
                Generating J2EE components (among others) quickly and reliably
                from models drawn in the graphical Unified Modeling Language is one of the
                primary features of AndroMDA.

            <p class="highlight">
                AndroMDA (pronounced: andromeda) is an open source code generation framework
                that follows the
                <a href="http://www.omg.org/mda">Model Driven Architecture</a>
                (MDA) paradigm. It takes model(s) from CASE-tool(s) and generates
                fully deployable applications and other components.

                Read more about AndroMDA, using the links on the left side menu. If you start
                using AndroMDA, we invite you to become a member of AndroMDA's
                <a href="http://forum.andromda.org">forum</a> where you can get <em>FREE</em> support.

                If you're interested in learning a little bit about the history of AndroMDA, read an
                <a href="http://www.codegeneration.net/tiki-read_article.php?articleId=8">interview with Matthias Bohlen</a>,
                the founder of AndroMDA.

                This is a <strong>*very*</strong> simplistic representation of what AndroMDA can do for you:
