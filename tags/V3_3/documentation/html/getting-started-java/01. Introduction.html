    <!------------------------- Intro Text ------------------------->
    <p>
        Understanding new tools and technologies can be a daunting task, and AndroMDA is
        no exception. This tutorial serves as a gentle introduction to the power of AndroMDA.
        We will show you step-by-step how to set up your development environment and build
        your first Java application. Instead of mechanically going through a series of steps,
        we will focus on ideas and concepts. Armed with this knowledge, you will be ready
        to take on real world challenges. Please set aside half a day of quality, uninterrupted
        time to learn AndroMDA, as there is lot to learn. Then, brew a good cup of coffee
        and immerse yourself in the wonderful world of Model Driven Architecture.

    <h3>What is AndroMDA?</h3>
    <p>
        AndroMDA (pronounced "Andromeda") is an extensible generator framework that adheres
        to the Model Driven Architecture (MDA) paradigm. It transforms UML models into deployable
        components for your favorite platform. While AndroMDA ships with cartridges that
        can generate code for several platforms and technologies, this tutorial will focus
        on generating a Java application.

        The paragraph above might have sounded like a lot of acronyms and marketing speak,
        but using AndroMDA means one main thing: <b>write less code</b>. Not only that,
        AndroMDA also lets you <b>create better applications</b> and maintain order on large
        projects. AndroMDA enforces best practices and lets developers focus on high level
        problems instead of wasting time on repetitive plumbing code. Additionally, AndroMDA
        can generate <b>highly customized enterprise quality code</b> to meet your project's
        very special needs.
    </p>
    <p>
        During development of large applications, most architects and developers already
        create class diagrams and data diagrams. These diagrams are usually made in tools
        like Visio, and the resulting artifacts are static pictures. When code changes,
        the diagrams must be updated. With AndroMDA, these diagrams become a living part
        of your application -- they are used to generate large portions of your application,
        and hence always reflect the current state of the system. When you need to modify
        your application, you change the model first, regenerate the code, and then add
        or update custom code as necessary. Thus, you get a production quality application
        out of assets that you had to create anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
        AndroMDA provides several cartridges out-of-the-box. For example, the Hibernate
        and Spring cartridges generate robust service and data layers for your application.
        In addition, database schema can be exported to script files to allow the creation
        of your application's database. There is also an easy way to map your model to an
        existing schema if your database has already been defined. If you wish to generate
        custom artifacts from your model, you can write a custom cartridge to accomplish
        this.
    </p>
    <h3>When to use AndroMDA?</h3>
    <p>
        AndroMDA is an extremely useful tool, but you should know when to use it.
    </p>
    <h4>AndroMDA is a great choice when</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>You are starting a new project</li>
        <li>You want to save time by generating as much code as possible</li>
        <li>You are building an application that stores its data in a database</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>AndroMDA might not be the best choice if</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Your application uses an existing database that cannot be easily mapped to an object
            model (for example, it does not use primary keys and object relationships are not
            clear)</li>
        <li>You already have a mature application with existing business objects and the incremental
            effort to model existing components is too high to provide enough value</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>What's Next?</h3>
    <p>
        Now that you understand what AndroMDA is and when you should use it, let's review
        some foundational concepts that form the basis of modern enterprise applications.
        After reviewing these concepts we will discuss how AndroMDA implements them in the
        applications it generates. Click the <em>Next</em> link below to explore this topic.
