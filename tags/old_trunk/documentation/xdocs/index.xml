                <strong>NEW</strong>: <a href="contrib/birds-eye-view.html">A bird's eye view of AndroMDA</a>,
                contributed by Joel Kozikowski. This guide is a step-by-step introduction to
                AndroMDA. Target audience: developers with Java experience who are new to AndroMDA
                or MDA in general.

                Did you ever think: "mmm... all this J2EE stuff is too complex! There must
                be an easier way to program?" Read the good news: AndroMDA is here to help!
                Generating J2EE components (among others) quickly and reliably
                from models drawn in the graphical Unified Modeling Language is one of the
                primary features of AndroMDA.

            <p class="highlight">
                AndroMDA (pronounced: andromeda) is an open source code generation framework
                that follows the
                <a href="http://www.omg.org/mda">Model Driven Architecture</a>
                (MDA) paradigm. It takes model(s) from CASE-tool(s) and generates
                fully deployable applications and other components.

                This is a <strong>*very*</strong> simplistic representation of what AndroMDA can do for you:
