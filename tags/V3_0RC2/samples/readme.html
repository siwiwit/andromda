       <title>Andromda Samples</title>

        The samples illustrate the use of AndroMDA with Maven.  
        Both the Animal Quiz and Car Rental System show typical
        AndroMDA project structures. 
        <p>
            Provided in this
            distribution is a maven plugin, you can use this
            plugin to generate your own application having the 
            same structure as these samples.  To run it, just install
            the plugin into your $MAVEN_HOME/plugins directory (copy the
            file maven-andromdapp-plugin-[VERSION-NAME].jar).  
            In the directory where you would like your project directory
            created enter 'maven andromdapp:generate'.  
        </p>
        <p>
            It's also possible to build an Ant based project with AndroMDA by 
            using the &#60;andromda&#62;. ant task (although its currently not shown in the
            samples).
        </p>
        <p>
            The following instructions assume you are familiar with operating
            a JBoss system.
        </p>
        <p>
            To build the samples, perform the following steps:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Install the latest version of <a href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven</a>
                    and add it to your $PATH or %PATH%
                </li>
                <li>
                    From this directory (the directory in which this file you're reading is located) type 'maven'; 
                    this will build all samples.  After the build has completed successfully,
                    follow the instructions for each sample below.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>   
        NOTE: After you've built the samples the first time, you can build them again 
              with the '-o' parameter passed to maven.  (i.e. you can
              type 'maven -o').  The '-o' tells Maven to build offline and since
              it isn't trying to download the dependencies, it will build much faster.

        <h2>OnlineStore application.</h2>
        <p>
            To run:
            <ol>
                <li>Copy the app/target/ ear file to [JBOSS_HOME]/server/[SERVER_NAME]/deploy</li>
                <li>[Re]Start JBoss.</li>
                <li>Open <a href="http://localhost:8080/OnlineStore">Local OnlineStore</a></li>
                <li>
                    The first page expects the user to enter his name and password, his
                    name must be at least 3 characters and start with a capital, the password
                    needs to be 6 characters or more and consists of alphanumerical characters
                    (both uppercase and lowercase), when the user clicks on 'proceed' we go to the
                    second page 
                </li>
                <li>
                    The second page lists items that can be purchased, the user can select
                    an arbitrary number of items from this list, there is also a checkbox
                    where to user can confirm he read the store's licence
                </li>
                <li>
                    The third and last page asks the user to enter his email and creditcard
                    number, he also needs to enter his age, which must be in a range from 12
                    to 112. After placing the order the application returns to the beginning.  
                </li>

        <h2>AnimalQuiz Sample</h2>
        <p>
            To run:
            <ol>
                <li>Copy the app/target/ ear file to [JBOSS_HOME]/server/[SERVER_NAME]/deploy</li>
                <li>
                    Check that HSQLDB TCP connnections are enabled. 
                    Edit [JBOSS_HOME]/server/[SERVER_NAME]/deploy/hsqldb-ds.xml
                    and uncomment two pragmas, one for the connection and one for the mbean.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If deploying against JBoss 4.x, remove the jboss-ws4ee.sar file from your jboss configuration's 
                    deploy directory. JBoss 4.x bundles axis libraries in this sar file and this causes problems for 
                    any other application deployed in the container that also bundles the axis libraries. As the animal 
                    quiz has web service support, it has the axis libraries bundled with it - hence the need to remove 
                    the ones JBoss provides. 
                </li>
                <li>[Re]Start JBoss as neccessary.</li>
                <li>
                    Change directory to samples/animal-quiz and 
                    execute maven create-schema. You may have to tweak the
					settings in project.properties if you change the database.
                </li>
                <li>Open <a href="http://localhost:8080/AnimalQuiz">Local AnimalQuiz</a></li>
                <li>Now you have to think of an animal and click the got one button.</li>
                <li>
                    The program will try to guess your choice. Initially after one guess,
                    elephant, it will give up and prompt you for the animal and question.
                </li>
