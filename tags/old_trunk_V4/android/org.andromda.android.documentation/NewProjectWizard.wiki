The *New AndroMDA Project Wizard* creates a new AndroMDA project. There will be two different wizards:
    * New AndroMDA Project wizard
    * New AndroMDA Cartridge Project wizard

---+++ New AndroMDA Project wizard
Creates a new AndroMDA project using the AndroMDA project generator (AndroMDApp:generate) to actuallay create the project.

See DefaultProjectModel for more information regarding the layout of this kind of project.

The wizard will ask the user some questions in order to find out how to configure the project.

_Note:_ Currently, the AndroMDA project generator is a simple Jelly script strted by maven. Accounting to this, the New AndroMDA Project wizard depends on maven. However, there are plans to replace the Jelly script with a plain Java class to make embedding the project generator more easy. See http://jira.andromda.org/browse/MAVEN-48.


---+++ New AndroMDA Cartridge wizard
Cartridge projects are specialized AndroMDA projects in that they also do contain a model and an AndroMDA configuration. Additionally, they contain a whole load of cartridge resources and have a special layout. See CartridgeProjectModel for more information.
