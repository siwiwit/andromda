      <h1>Components quickly with AndroMDA</h1>

      <p class="std">
        Did you ever think: "mmm... all this J2EE stuff is too complex! There must
        be an easier way to program?" Read the good news: AndroMDA is here to help
        you! Generating J2EE components quickly and reliably from models drawn in the
        graphical Unified Modeling Language is the main feature of AndroMDA.
      </p>

      <p class="std">
        AndroMDA (pronounced: andromeda) is an open source code generation framework
        that follows the <a href="http://www.omg.org/mda">model driven architecture</a>
        (MDA) paradigm. It takes a UML model from a CASE-tool and generates
        classes and deployable components (J2EE or other), specific for your
        application architecture.

        using AndroMDA, we invite you to subscribe to the project's
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=73047">mailing lists</a>. Another
        interesting place to watch is the Code Generation Network site where
        you can read an
        <a href="http://www.codegeneration.net/tiki-read_article.php?articleId=8">interview with Matthias Bohlen</a>, the lead engineer
        behind AndroMDA.

    <news name="Partnering with NoMagic, Inc." href="http://www.magicdraw.com/">
      <p>
          We have chosen MagicDraw UML to use on our development and support it
          with AndroMDA for our user community. MagicDraw has won several prizes
          in the Java developer community. We found that it features a very
          good performance and is stable and mature. Recommended!

    <news name="AndroMDA as a Poseidon plug-in" href="http://www.gentleware.com/products/download.php4">
      <p>
          AndroMDA now runs as a plug-in with Poseidon, Gentleware's widely known
          CASE tool. You will see that code generation runs much faster than in
          stand-alone mode because AndroMDA can now access the model directly in
          Poseidon's memory.
