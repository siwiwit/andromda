This sample project demonstrates how to generate a very simple report from an UML model.

Usually AndroMDA can only generate code from UML if there is at least one model element
that has had a stereotype assigned to it.  But what does one do if one wants to generate 
a report from somebody elses UML model and that model has no stereotyped model elements?

This sample provides a simple illustration of how that can be done without editing the UML.
