/**
 * <p>
 * Provides access to a model loaded by a Repository and made available to be
 * used by metafacades.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Models can be instances of any metamodel. The most common models will be UML
 * models. This interface is an abstraction. Any model that implements this
 * interface can be used with AndroMDA.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Design goal: This class should only contain the <b>minimum amount of methods
 * </b> that will be needed such that the AndroMDA core can deal with it. All
 * other stuff should be done in cartridge-specific classes!!! So, please don't
 * make this class grow!
